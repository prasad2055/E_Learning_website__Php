With each meal, I face the possibility of becoming nauseous after eating. As a result, I tend to avoid large portions, greasy, or overly sweet foods.

The President then sent back the bill to the parliament with 15 different recommendations/ suggestions which was within the prerogative of the President. However, both the houses passed the bill again without making any changes whatsoever. The President is then under the constitutional obligation to pass the bill within 15 days. However, the President failed to do so. This amounts to violation of the constitutional provision on the part of the President. The inability to solve the issue of Citizenship is pushing more and more people into statelessness every year. Thousands of people who are denied the citizenship are deprived of basic privileges offered by the state</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earlier bill to amend the Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006 had been pending in parliament since 7 August 2018. Despite repetitive discussions, the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House of Representatives were not able to reach an agreement on the bill. Then, the cabinet meeting decided to table a new one by removing the existing one. Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand put forth a withdrawal proposal on July 8 2022 for the bill amending citizenship that had been introduced by the previous CPN-UML administration. The main purpose of the second amendment to the citizenship bill was to address the worries of non-residents and stateless individuals. The National Assembly already passed the bill that the House of Representatives approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The President’s refusal regarding authenticating the bill is facing huge criticisms. Five written petitions were issued against her. The Supreme Court has also issued a show-cause notice, asking for reasons behind her decision. &nbsp;The President is yet to submit it. According to some political observers, the President’s decision to invite party leaders and voice her concerns was improper because the decorum does not provide for such activism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Citizenship Act, on the other hand, contains a few clauses that violate equality rights. For instance, Article 11 (2.b.) states that a child born to a Nepalese mother or father (who holds citizenship) will receive citizenship by descent. Likewise, Article 11(5) states that the person born to a Nepalese mother but an unidentified father can be granted citizenship by descent. This demonstrates a gender disparity and violates a mother’s “Rights to Equality” because it is only women who must first declare that the father is unidentifiable in order for their kid to be given citizenship. The father’s side is not obligated to make any such declarations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome observers believe that &nbsp;since the president is close to CPN- UML, it might be UML’s political motive to garner votes in the upcoming national and provincial polls. The CPN-UML intends to make marriage based naturalization without cooling period an election agenda linking it with nationalism. Each of Nepal’s neighbors has established a certain waiting period before applicants are allowed to submit citizenship applications. The proposed bill is silent on the previous provision of marital naturalized citizenship for foreigners marrying to Nepali men without any cooling period. A section of people are worried that removing the waiting period will make citizenship less valuable.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the constitution not allowing for such activism, the experts state that the constitution lacks a “clear provision” stating what will occur if she does not authenticate the bill, the President will neither support the bill in its current form nor resign. Does the bill itself become law if it is not passed? It is unclear what action the relevant authorities should take as a result of the constitutional flaw.</p>', NULL, 2616, NULL, NULL, 'Simran Kharel', '/uploads/banner_image/1670560702_Bidya-bhandari-1.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-10', '2022-10-21', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 16:23:22', '2023-01-03 21:32:53'),

The four-day visit of the eight-member team marked the second high-profile visit from Beijing within the span of four months after the ratification of the US’s MCC pact by Nepal in February. Beijing had crossed diplomatic lines in labelling the MCC pact as a “pandora box” and had lobbied to not ratify the pact. Immediately after the ratification of the pact by the parliament, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Nepal in late March. The routine visits of foreign leaders form an integral part of cooperative engagement and visits of Chinese leaders could also be seen in a diplomatic light as an attempt to court Kathmandu. However, it is clear that there is much more to these heightened Chinese engagements than mere diplomatic manoeuvres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beijing hasn’t hidden its interests in uniting the communist parties of Nepal and reinstating the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) ideological counterpart in Baluwatar. It is, therefore, that the flurry of high-profile visits from China holds significance when talks of the communist coalition are already making rounds within Nepal. Even during this visit, Liu’s team is reported to have urged communist leaders to reconcile their differences and unite once again or at least forge an electoral coalition for the upcoming provincial and federal elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beijing has perceived the ratification of the MCC pact as evidence of Nepal slipping away from its sphere of influence – and ever since, it has escalated engagements with Nepali politicos to restore the lost influence that Beijing enjoyed while the communist coalition (the NCP) was at the helm of the Kathmandu administration. And to restore the lost influence, Beijing wants the communist forces to reunite again. The ideological affinity between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the communist parties of Nepal makes it easier for Beijing to exert influence over Kathmandu – albeit communism now is largely relegated to a nominal identity by both the Chinese and Nepali communist parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn’t the first time that China has gone to length in facilitating the coalition or merger of the Nepali communist parties. The CCP leaders had played an instrumental role back in 2017 in bringing together two main communist parties – CPN UML and CPN Maoist Center – which had led to the formation of the NCP. In 2019, the CCP leaders even trained the leaders of the NCP on “Xi’s thought”. Chinese influence in Nepal had reached its heyday when the NCP was in power. For instance, Nepal had voted in favour of Beijing’s new security law for Hong Kong introduced in the midst of Hong Kong pro-democratic protest – which had provisions of harsh penalties for vaguely defined political crimes– at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHCR).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only did China receive Nepal’s support on the international platforms but also Beijing had greater influence over the internal affairs of Kathmandu as long as the NCP remained in power. Later, when the NCP was on the verge of a split, China through its ambassador Hou Yanqi made several attempts to avert it but to no avail. Then, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, during his visit in late March, asserted that China would make concerted efforts to explore the governance model conducive to economic stability and growth. This statement too hinted at facilitating a communist coalition – the statement could be construed as Beijing’s desire to see some replica of the Chinese communist authoritarian governance model in Nepal in the long run. Now that provincial and federal elections are nearby, Liu has asked the communist parties to reunite again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In essence, these attempts of China to push for the communist coalition amount to direct interference in the internal affairs of Nepal and cross all diplomatic lines that a nation is supposed to adhere to. The call for jointly exploring a governance model conducive to stability and growth is tantamount to the call for a regime change in a euphemized tone. The call is not only against the diplomatic protocols but also undermines the autonomy of a sovereign nation. After decades of political transition, and a herculean task of state restructuring, Nepal has secured a multiparty democratic governance model as its cherished achievement – and China’s repeated calls to search for a better governance model and direct interferences could become major challenges in our transition to democratic maturity. Further, that China no longer pretends to obfuscate its newfound approaches in interfering with Nepal’s internal affairs doesn’t portend well for the relationship between the two nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other front, those issues that China should have prioritized in these high-profile visits have largely been sidelined. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project has been in limbo for years now – and China has shown little to no interest in giving the project the much-needed traction. The agreement of the BRI project with Nepal, its loan component and other issues surrounding the project should have been the major agenda of the visit. Similarly, cooperation between the two nations on multiple fronts – trade, education, health, and environment among others – should have been prioritized. But it appears as if China seems occupied with the intensifying geopolitical rivalry in the region and is making attempts to court Kathmandu again to score a goal against the US-India camp rather than genuinely seeking to deepen the Kathmandu-Beijing ties.</p>', NULL, 2616, NULL, NULL, 'Sourav Dahal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670561141_Liu-Jianchao-the-head-of-the-International-Liaison-Department-of-the-Chinese-Communist-Party-has-arrived-in-Kathmandu-for-a-visit..jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-07', '2022-07-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 16:30:41', '2022-12-09 18:41:30'),

The annual growth rate of CPI in April 2022 amounted to 9.2% in OECD countries. Nepal’s economy was recovering from the effect of the earthquake and the six-months Indian blockade that both occurred in 2015. This current crisis has further weakened Nepal’s vulnerable economy. Nepal encountered high inflation (Inflation based-CPI jumped to 7.28 % in April 2022 and to 7.87 % last May on y-o-y basis). While Nepal relies mainly on imports and due to the inflation, the import’s price hikes resulted in a depreciation of the NRP as well as a significant compression of foreign reserves. On a micro-economic level, the supply chain encountered constraints due to the rise in production costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">How ‘less is more’ become a business strategy…</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To face this dreadful economic situation, companies must implement a business strategy to face the curbs in profits. To cope with inflation, companies decided to “downsize” – also referred to as shrinkflation. It consists in reducing products package’s size, which people hardly notice while maintaining the same price. This strategy has been implemented since the 1970s and knew a surge after 2008. This way companies can better cope with production costs surge while avoiding loss of competitiveness. The chore of the strategy lies in that consumer are more price conscious rather than ‘weight conscious’, especially when the labels have been changed in a more discrete one, making the downsizing less obvious. This strategy is used globally by companies in the US, and the UK – where inflation is particularly high (between 6 to 8%). India, also experiencing a similar level of inflation, has seen its companies like Clinic Plus, Parle, or Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) implementing this business strategy focusing on poor rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Why shrinkflation seems to be the safest option for retailers?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When a company’s production costs increase, it mainly has three options: produce smaller packages, change the ingredients, or raise the price of the final product. In our economic context, changing ingredients can be quite risky. Indeed, changing ingredients means using cheaper ingredients which deteriorates the product’s quality. Another option is to raise prices. Given the current economic health, increasing price is not an option. So, getting packages smaller seems to be the safest for business at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other side, on the customer’s level, shrinkflation also affects consumers’ shopping habits. Already because of inflation, consumers focus their consumption on the most important items: groceries, electricity, and fuel. Also, as reported in an article of the NPR, some decide pragmatically to buy the whole piece of cheese instead of buying the pre-sliced one. Further, retailers have identified new trends in consumer habits as reported by the Times of India. Downsizing the package makes consumers ‘look for packs that offer value’. This is why, HUL, has decided to create and produce bridge packs (between two price points) ‘to provide the right price-value equation to its consumers, ensuring that products remain affordable and accessible’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">This practice has pushed consumers rights association to speak up …</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if this business strategy is not illegal, it remains tricky. For that specific reason, concealing the price hinders consumer rights. This practice affects the ability of the consumer to make informed choices. Indeed, given the small difference in size between the previous and new products, the consumer is not able to notify the change, and thus chose which product is the most suitable for them. This is one of the reasons why some Consumer Protection associations advise looking at the price per kilo instead of the price of the product. In an interview to CESIF, Mr. Hari Prasad Mainali, secretary of the Forum For Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal, restated the Article 44-1 of the Constitution stating that “every consumer shall have the right to obtain quality goods and services”, which rights have been reassured by 2074’s Consumer Act. According to Ratula Chakraborty, professor of business management at the University of EastAnglia, suppliers, and retailers should be obliged to notify the customer that the product has been downsized through a label for a period of at least one month.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">… for valid reasons.</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, companies may use marketing to justify such business strategies: praising the lower environmental cost of the package, standing for the health of the consumers as it limits ‘passive’ overeating, or supporting the innovatoin of the brand for a more efficient product. However, this practice questioned the choices and strategies used by these companies after food giants realized huge profits during the pandemic. Indeed, last may an OXFAM report revealed that 62 new food billionaires have been created over the last two years while global food prices have spiraled by over 30% . Thus, it widely questions the necessity to adopt such practices as shrinkflation. Meanwhile, chairman of Rasna Group, Piruz Khambatta and Sahil Gilani, Gits Food Products Sales &amp; Marketing Director, declared to the Times of India that they won’t be running any promotional offers given they are already absorbing cost inflation. S.Charlebois, professor of Food Distribution and Policy, Dalhouse University, reported his doubts in an article for The Conversation regarding the tendency of this business strategy to contribute to inflation. Indeed, we refer to it as an “invisible inflation” because it challenges statistics to get adjusted sufficiently and efficiently, making this inflation more vicious.</p>', NULL, 2616, NULL, NULL, 'Maela Merrer', '/uploads/banner_image/1670561699_bannershrinkflation.png', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-07', '2022-07-07', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 16:39:59', '2022-12-09 18:41:15'),

The checkpoints at Kerung and Tatopani, which had been closed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic have since reopened, however, traders and locals claim that they are not fully operational. Reports say that the checkpoints which were used to import 200 to 250 truckloads of goods daily are only allowing 20 vehicles at present. While China had earlier cited Covid-19 concerns for restricted transportation, the reopening of checkpoints has not increased the flow of vehicles. Furthermore, trade at the Northern border appears to be happening on Chinese terms with increasing imports and negligible export. Nepali officials have said that the lack of diplomatic initiative from the Nepali government is to blame for the stalemate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal-China relations have also suffered blows on the diplomatic front. Nepal is currently embroiled in a border dispute with China wherein local government officials in Humla district of Karnali Province have alleged Chinese encroachment on Nepali territory. Protests over the matter urged the Chinese Embassy in Nepal to release a statement denying the allegations. The Foreign Ministry of Nepal soon released a statement in line with the Chinese Embassy. However, allegations persist with inconsistency among positions held by Nepali authorities. Such occurrences have also led analysts to believe that Nepal-China ties have deteriorated, especially under the new ruling dispensation led by Sher Bahadur Deuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Nepal’s relationship with India and the United States appears to be thawing despite outstanding bilateral issues, there has been limited engagement with China. Nepal has participated in two disaster response related exercises with the United States and has also participated in a traditional military exercise with India. Similarly, the Nepal-India Bilateral Consultative Group’s meeting on security issues took place under the leadership of Foreign Ministry after being halted for two years. Furthermore, trade with India has smoothened with the ease of restrictions along the southern border. Moreover, the visit of the Secretary-general of BIMSTEC to Nepal in the first month of the year was also perceived as a positive signal towards the rejuvenation of BIMSTEC.

The rest of the parties have proposed that the vote share of the 2017 federal and provincial elections instead should be the basis for seat-sharing. This is because the Nepali Congress had emerged as the largest party in the 2022 local polls while it had performed dismally in the 2017 elections.

With a coalition of five parties now in place, a consensus has to be reached for a single candidate in each constituency from an even larger pool of aspirants. It is, therefore, that the electoral coalition has also intensified intra-party tension – particularly within the Nepali Congress. The faction led by Shekar Koirala organized a “warning program” to warn the establishment of the party not to budge from a hundred-seat demand, and within that provide at least forty seats to the Koirala-led faction.

In failing to authenticate the bill, President Bhandari has violated the constitutional provisions. Five major writ petitions were filed asking for Supreme Court’s intervention in the matter – and on September 15, the Supreme Court issued a show-cause notice against the President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Bhandari’s move seems politically motivated with an intention of weaponizing the amendment bill to facilitate her former party CPN UML in the upcoming provincial and federal polls. The amendment bill has long been dragged into controversy – and attempts have been made mainly by the main opposition CPN UML to make it a major electoral agenda by framing the bill as an issue concerning nationality and sovereignty. With the ruling alliance joining hands for the polls, the electoral prospects of the CPN UML have weakened – and the party was in a search of a sellable electoral agenda. The CPN UML has now labelled the ruling alliance as “anti-nationalist” citing some provisions of the amendment bill with an ulterior motive of cashing electoral success in the forthcoming polls. President Bhandari has sought to blow this issue out of proportion by not authenticating the bill – and in doing so, has buttressed her former party’s effort. The motive is also evident from the fact that when the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli-led government had brought an ordinance with similar provisions, President had shown no reluctance in endorsing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitution of Nepal 2015 envisions President as the protector and patron of the constitution; however, President Bhandari has failed to even live up to the bare minimum standards of being non-partisan. In these formative days of Nepal’s republican system, it is imperative that the President set up a culture – that of strictly abiding by the constitution – to establish the institution of the Presidency as a cherished one within the system. However, President Bhandari’s proclivities over her two-time tenure have tainted the institution of the Presidency with partisan stains, and have served to reduce public confidence and trust in the system as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Crisis in Judiciary Prolongs</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 17, the Impeachment Recommendation Committee submitted its report to the speaker of the Lower House Agni Prasad Sapkota with a conclusion that there are ample grounds to impeach Chief Justice Rana.

While quizzed, Chief Justice Rana defended himself with a claim that he hasn’t committed any wrongdoings whatsoever. Rana rather pointed fingers with incendiary remarks against political leaders, particularly that of the ruling alliance, along with other judges, advocates, media and business houses – and accused that all those who are for impeaching him have been responsible for plaguing the judicial system of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Impeachment Recommendation Committee submitted its report just a few hours before the five-year tenure of the lower house ended.

This reflects brazen irresponsibility on the part of the ruling alliance – particularly the Deuba-led government as it is now clear that the government wants to keep the impeachment motion in limbo until the tenure of Chief Justice Rana gets over. On the other side, there has been some legal confusion – if or not the impeachment is rendered null and void now that the tenure of the lower house is over. Seizing upon this, Chief Justice Rana made attempts to return back to the Supreme Court and resume his duty.

And then immediately a day after, on August 5, the ruling coalition set up an 11-member task force to find out a framework for sharing seats in the upcoming federal and provincial elections. The task force consisted of three members from the Nepali Congress, and two each from the rest of the five-party alliance. On August 15, the task force reached a consensus on four criteria for seat sharing: (i) FPTP seats won in the 2017 elections, (ii) PR seats won in the 2017 elections, (iii) performance in last May’s local election, and (iv) priority to top leaders of the parties. Later, it was decided that the main decisions of seat-sharing were to be finalized not by the task force but rather by the top leaders themselves. As of now, the Nepali Congress is bargaining for a hundred seats, the Maoist Center sixty, the Unified Socialist forty, Janata Samajwadi thirty-two and the Rashtriya Janamorcha two seats. It is expected that the consensus will be eventually reached such that the Nepali Congress will field around eighty-five to ninety candidates, CPN Maoist Center around fifty, CPN Unified Socialist fifteen, People’s Socialist Party fifteen and CPN Jana Morcha one candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the ruling alliance has almost agreed on seat-sharing, the month-long speculations regarding the reconfiguration of alliances for the upcoming polls have almost come to an end. The communist coalition including the CPN UML had been making buzz around for months – particularly because in 2017, the CPN Maoist Center had eventually joined hands with the CPN UML for the federal and provincial elections after forging an electoral coalition with Nepali Congress for the local polls. This time around, the communist forces and the Nepali Congress are plunging into the election together – despite the odds that the communist coalition could have easily translated into electoral success compared to this alliance of ruling parties with conflicting ideologies and contrasting voter bases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coalition marks a continuation of the electoral alliance formed for the local polls held last May. While the Nepali Congress and the CPN Maoist Center had ripped off the maximum benefit of the electoral coalition, other parties hadn’t benefited in equal proportion. This time around, both the Nepali Congress and the communist parties of the alliance have formed a strategy to carve out maximum benefit from the electoral collaboration. The Nepali Congress has aimed at emerging as the clear winner with a margin such that the nearest rival would remain far off in total seats won while the rest of the parties are making attempts to collectively put leverage upon the Nepal Congress to ensure a maximum number of seats for themselves. To this end, the communist parties of the ruling alliance also formed a Socialist Center last month. On 22 August, two main parties of the Socialist Center – the CPN Maoist Center and the CPN Unified Socialist decided to contest the election with a single manifesto. Further, Baburam Bhattarai who recently split the People’s Socialist Party to form Nepal Socialist Party and Bamdev Gautam, who has been on a mission to unite communist forces, have reached an agreement with the Maoist Center to contest the election under the symbol of the CPN Maoist Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The electoral coalition however is likely to intensify the intraparty feuds within the big parties of the alliance, particularly the Nepali Congress and the CPN Maoist Center. Even if parties weren’t to form an electoral coalition, internal management of aspirant candidates would be a challenge because a large number of leaders is vying to contest elections from each constituency. With the electoral coalition now in place, there has to be an inter-party consensus candidate from an even larger set of aspirants. The intraparty tension, regarding the same, is already rife within Nepali Congress. The Shekhar Koirala faction which has remained against electoral coalitions has now upped its ante against the establishment faction of the party.This is to ensure that as many leaders from the faction are ensured with the election tickets. The case is similar to the rest of the parties of the ruling alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the talks of an opposition coalition between the CPN UML, Kamal Thapa-led Rashtriya Prajatantra Party and the rest have been making rounds – there hasn’t been any concrete development yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">President’s Partisan Proclivity in the Citizenship Act 2006 Amendment Bill</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>President Bidya Devi Bhandari, on August 14, returned the Citizenship Act 2006 Amendment Bill back to the parliament for a review enlisting fifteen different concerns/suggestions on the 15th day she received it from the Speaker. The bill which was endorsed by both the houses was sent to the Sheetal Niwas for authentication on July 31. However, on 18 August, the lower house endorsed the bill again without making any changes whatsoever. The President has the prerogative of returning the bill back to the parliament for review but if the upper house also chooses not to make further changes to it following the suit of the lower house, the President then will have no other constitutional option other than to authenticate the bill as it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Bhandari’s move to send back the amendment bill was a constitutional one, nevertheless, it has attracted controversy – and rightly so. This is because President has resorted to partisan proclivities time and again. For instance – while the erstwhile PM KP Sharma Oli dissolved the lower house twice unconstitutionally, President Bhandari had gone to length in facilitating those unconstitutional moves and later she had even made attempts to prevent the split of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) which was formed with the unification of the CPN UML and the CPN Maoist Center. Even in this case of the amendment bill, President Bhandari’s position resembles close to that of the CPN UML – the party she belonged to before her ascendency to the role of president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also reported that President Bhandari took advice from unauthorized people regarding the amendment bill– the constitution clearly states that the Attorney General and the cabinet ministers are the ones that the President has to rely on for advice. Further, once the lower house endorsed the bill again making no changes, President then met with retired and incumbent army officials including the chief of Army staff Prabhu Ram Sharma. This flurry of consultations with unauthorized people and army officials isn’t in line with the decorum that the President is supposed to maintain. When President Bhandari has no alternative but to authenticate the bill once the parliament holds deliberations over her suggestions and chooses either or not to make any further changes – barring her resignation from the post – the prudent course of action on her part would have been to avoid such controversial meetups. On the contrary, President Bhandari’s heightened activism – seemingly in preparation to not authenticate the bill– marks yet another partisan proclivity among numerous in her two-time tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Impeachment Motion against the Chief Justice</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>On August 7, the Parliament Secretariat forwarded the impeachment motion against Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana to the Impeachment Recommendation Committee after six months of its registration. Chief Justice Rana has been in suspension after lawmakers of the ruling coalition filed an impeachment motion on February 13 charging him with twenty-one different allegations. On March 15, the Deuba government had abruptly decided to prorogue the winter session of the parliament just a day before the House was supposed to hold deliberations over the impeachment motion. Ever since then, the impeachment motion has been in limbo and the judicial crisis has been prolonged for months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This delay reflects irresponsibility on the part of the government and the ruling coalition. It is imperative that impeachment against the Chief Justice be prioritized and parliamentary decision over it be sought promptly – which was not to be. Now that the Impeachment Recommendation Committee has already quizzed Chief Justice Rana on August 31st, and has proposed the deadline of September 14 to review the impeachment motion, Judiciary can be expected to get the much-needed relief soon.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Sourav Dahal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670574869_Cholendra.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-08', '2022-10-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 20:19:29', '2022-12-11 23:02:18'),

The party also decided to come up with a strategic framework for candidates’ selection and seat sharing in such a way that Nepali Congress’ majority in both the provincial and federal polls could be ensured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, on the other side, the communist parties of the ruling alliance have decided to form a “Socialist Center”. And by doing so, those parties have aimed at exerting leverage collectively over both the Nepali Congress and the CPN UML. The Socialist Center includes CPN Maoist (Center), CPN Unified Socialist, and the Baburam Bhattarai-led faction which is expelled from the Janata Samajwadi Party. As of now, the socialist coalition remains open to the possibility of an electoral collaboration either with the Nepali Congress or with the CPN UML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CPN Maoist Center’s leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda has frequently claimed that his party intends to forge an electoral coalition with the Nepali Congress. Dahal visited India from 15 to 17 July, and during his visit, he met Nepali Congress’s leader Arju Rana Deuba who also happens to be the first lady, in the presence of Indian leaders. This meeting was met with speculations – that the two reached a consensus in the mediation of Indian leaders on power-sharing after the provincial and federal elections. Dahal has categorically denied this allegation – however, since the communist coalition isn’t in the interest of New Delhi, speculations are rife about the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other leaders of the proposed “Socialist Center”, on the other hand, have claimed that the coalition with the CPN UML is equally likely. CPN Unified Socialist’s senior leader Jhala Nath Khanal and leaders of the CPN Maoist Center – Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Barsha Man Pun – have even gone on to say that the electoral alliance of the communist forces including the CPN UML is at the top of their priority. And that only if the communist coalition fails to materialize, the Socialist Center would join hands with the Nepali Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the CPN Maoist Center benefitted heavily from the electoral coalition of the ruling alliance in the local polls, the Nepali Congress had ripped off the maximum benefits. The rest of the parties, however, couldn’t benefit much owing to their own weak organizational base and shrunk vote bank. The communist coalition, on the other hand, appears attractive to communist parties of the ruling alliance – this is because a communist coalition could smoothly translate into electoral success, unlike the ruling alliance which consists of parties with conflicting ideologies and contrasting voter bases. Even the last time around, in 2017, the CPN Maoist Center had first contested the local polls forging an electoral alliance with the Nepali Congress, but then had switched the camp for the subsequent provincial and federal elections joining hands with the CPN UML. The communist coalition is also in the interest of the CPN UML because the party has undergone multiple splits and has been pushed to the distant second position in the local polls held last May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of now, both the ruling electoral alliance and communist electoral alliance seem equally likely and it is only plausible that the proposed Socialist Centre would eventually join the camp which would ensure the Center with a bigger share in the coalition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">The Head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Party, Liu Jianchao Visited Nepal</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Liu Jianchao, the head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, visited Nepal on July 10. The four-day visit of the eight-member team marked the second high- profile visit from Beijing within the span of four months after the ratification of the US’s MCC pact by Nepal in February. During this visit, Liu’s team is reported to have urged communist leaders to reconcile their differences and unite once again or at least forge an electoral coalition for the upcoming provincial and federal elections. Even Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in March had made statements along the same lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These attempts/statements of China to push for the communist coalition amount to direct interference in the internal affairs of Nepal and cross all diplomatic lines that a nation is supposed to adhere to. On the other front, those issues that China should have prioritized in these high-profile visits have largely been sidelined. These proclivities hint that Beijing is preoccupied with attempts to reassert its lost influence over Kathmandu, which it enjoyed during the Oli administration, and is occupied with motives of scoring goals against the US-India camp, rather than genuinely seeking to deepen the Kathmandu-Beijing ties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Finance Minister Janardan Sharma Resigned Amid Controversy</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>On 6 July, Finance Minister Janardan Sharma resigned amidst controversy for allegedly allowing two unauthorized people – a retired senior non-gazette officer and a chartered accountant – to make last-minute changes in taxation for the budget of the fiscal year 2022-23 with a purported motive of benefiting some business groups. A vernacular daily, Annapurna Post, had published a news report on the same – and parliamentarians from across the aisle had sought clarifications with Minister Sharma. The main opposition CPN UML had been demanding the resignation ever since the news broke out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 6 July itself, the House of Representatives formed the Parliamentary Probe Special Committee to look into the matter – the committee consisted of four lawmakers, two each from the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Center, and one each from the CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party and Loktrantrik Samajwadi Party. However, the Finance Ministry failed to provide the CCTV footage of May 28, the day prior to the budget announcement, with a claim that only 13 days’ recording was possible to store. The probe committee then reached the conclusion that the CCTV footage of May 28 and 29 was deleted in a premeditated manner. However, on July 28, the probing committee released its final report stating that the charges levelled against Sharma couldn’t be confirmed. Those two lawmakers from the opposition CPN UML in the investigation committee cried foul – and experts argued that there were multiple lapses and flaws during the investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That the Finance Ministry deleted the CCTV footage of the day in a premeditated manner is telling in itself. On the other hand, PM Deuba failed to take quick actions against the finance minister which raises further doubts – if all this was done in a tacit agreement of the PMO. This isn’t the first time that the crony capitalist nexus has gamed the system to its advantage while eroding institution procedures and the rule of law. In this regard, this entire controversy, on a broader level, is reflective of the extending crony capitalist nexus which has paralyzed the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">The House of Representatives Endorsed an Amendment Bill to the Citizenship Act, 2006.</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>On 22nd July, the House of Representatives endorsed an amendment bill to the Citizenship Act, 2006 with a majority vote despite objections from the main opposition, CPN UML. The amendment bill has been a matter of controversy ever since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015 – a couple of previous attempts to amend the act had failed. The main bone of contention was about the cooling-off period for foreign women married to a Nepali man. Previously, both CPN UML and the CPN Maoist Center were for a cooling-off period of at least seven years. However, this time around, the CPN Maoist Center backtracked from its position, and then the ruling alliance had enough numbers to amend the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The parliamentary endorsement of the bill, however, has triggered a debate – while some argue that having no provisions for the cooling-off period would do more harm than good, others rightfully claim that the amendment remains gender-biased as it gives the continuity to preferential treatment for males. Despite this bias, the bill is important in the sense that it has addressed major demands of the Madhes-based parties: allowing citizenship of dissent for children of those who acquired citizenship by birth and naturalized citizenship to foreign women married to men. On the other hand, the CPN UML – a communist party catering to the conservative/ethno-nationalist vote bank – has made attempts to politicize the bill to its electoral advantage. The CPN UML has claimed that this amendment would encourage an influx of foreign females by marrying Nepali males with the motive of gaining Nepali Citizenship – and with this, the party has aimed at consolidating its base amongst the hill-based conservative constituencies.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Sourav Dahal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670575537_Liu-Jianchao-the-head-of-the-International-Liaison-Department-of-the-Chinese-Communist-Party-has-arrived-in-Kathmandu-for-a-visit.

Flynn in his meetings with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Army chief General Prabhu Ram Sharma raised the issue of Nepal’s participation in the United States government’s State Partnership Program (SPP) which sparked off a controversy. Initially, all major parties and the army denied their role in proposing the program to the US – and maintained that no agreements whatsoever had been reached about the same. However, on 16 June, a proposal letter sent by Nepal Army with the government’s authorization to establish the National Guard State Partnership Program was leaked to the media. Then, all involved parties shifted the blame to the others while refusing their involvement in the process. On 20 June, the government decided to not participate in the SPP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The State Partnership Program of the US entails security cooperation and exchanges between militaries of the two nations among others – and this provision became the major bone of contention. Although Nepal’s military has been cooperating in various ways with the militaries of other nations, of late, there have been few signs of Nepal being the flashpoint of US-Sino superpower rivalry in the Himalayan region – and in this context, the prospect of military cooperation with the US resulted in the politicisation of the SPP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make the matter worse, both the ruling coalition led by the Nepali Congress and the main opposition CPN Unified Marxist Leninist (UML) sought to gain out of the controversy surrounding the SPP. It is a general practice among mainstream political parties of Nepal to drag issues of foreign affairs into controversy and blame the rival parties for undermining national sovereignty while working under foreign influence. The SPP controversy is no different and is eerily reminiscent of the hotly debated MCC (Millennium Challenge Corporation) pact which had finally ended up with the parliamentary ratification. The opposition CPN UML attempted to capitalise on the SPP controversy and forge into the upcoming elections with an agenda of nationalism branding oneself as the only party which could safeguard the sovereignty of the nation, and resist foreign influence. However, it was later revealed that the government of the CPN UML too was involved in authorising the Nepal Army to request the SPP program. The main party of the ruling alliance Nepali Congress too tried to shift the blame on the CPN UML citing that the proposal letter was sent when CPN UML’s leader K P Sharma Oli was heading the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in the case of the MCC, all major political parties are equally involved in the SPP, either in proposing the US for the program or in signing the leaked agreement. On June 20, the government then decided to terminate the program and by doing so, put an end to confusion surrounding the SPP. This move of the government was also propelled by criticisms of politicians across the spectrum and experts alike who expressed concerns over the nature of the program and its geopolitical implications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this SPP saga has once again revealed the duplicity of politicians, their penchant for dragging issues of foreign affairs into controversy for political gains and blame-shifting. These tendencies of politicians when it comes to matters of foreign affairs have made it difficult for our friendly partners in dealing with us, and have called into question the credibility of our political leaders and institutions alike.Early indications of fissures within the ruling coalition</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of now, both the ruling electoral alliance and communist electoral alliance seem equally likely and it is only plausible that the proposed Socialist Centre would eventually join the camp which would ensure the Center with a bigger share in the coalition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A member party of the ruling alliance CPN Unified Socialist has repeatedly blamed other parties of the alliance for not cooperating fully in the local polls held last May which it believes was the major reason behind its dismal electoral performance. Ever since, talks about the possible communist coalition – like the one in the general election of 2017 – have been making some buzz around among the politicians. A faction led by Madhav Kumar Nepal had split from the CPN UML primarily over the chairman K P Sharma Oli, who was then Prime Minister, attempts to dissolve the lower house twice – and the splinter faction formed the CPN Unified Socialist as a new party. The party however couldn’t perform well in the last local poll and won only twenty local units of seven hundred and fifty-three. On the other side, the CPN UML also got pushed to the distant second position in the local polls – and the party split was one among many reasons behind that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this, talks regarding the possible communist coalition have started making rounds as it could be in the interest of both the parties CPN UML and CPN Unified Socialist. The next communist party CPN Maoist Centre, however, benefited heavily from the ruling coalition in the local polls, and as of now, Maoist Centre seems interested in continuing with the ruling coalition itself. The CPN Maoist Centre’s leader has repeatedly asserted that the ruling coalition will forge an electoral alliance even for the forthcoming polls, and the Nepali Congress has attached incentives in continuing with the same coalition. However, there are reports of talks going on between the leaders of the CPN Maoist Center, CPN UML and CPN Unified Socialist for the coalition. A senior communist leader who hasn’t chosen any of the three sides after the split of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), Bamdev Gautam, has initiated talk with all three communist parties – and other leaders are also said to be involved in finding a common ground for the communist coalition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other side, there have been some intraparty tensions within the People’s Socialist Party. It is reported that the party is on the verge of a split as two leaders Upendra Yadav and Baburam Bhattarai have failed to reach a consensus on multiple issues of contention. There are also reports of talk between CPN Maoist Centre’s top leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda) and Unified Socialist leader Baburam Bhattarai regarding the formation of a new socialist party. Baburam Bhattarai had left the Maoist party after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015 with an agenda of “alternative politics”, and as his party failed to gain traction, the party had merged with Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal to form Samajwadi Party, Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These recent developments herald a likely realigning of parties in the ruling and opposition coalitions. However, it is way too early to definitely predict how those alliances will shape out. Of late, electoral alliances have been a common phenomenon in polls – and how those coalitions get shaped for the forthcoming provincial and federal elections will determine the trajectory of Nepali politics.Finance Minister Janardhan Sharma and Judiciary in a Controversy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vernacular daily, Annapurna Post, published a news report alleging Finance Minister Janardhan Sharma of allowing two unauthorised individuals to determine tax rates for the fiscal year 2022-23. It was reported that Sharma instructed four senior finance ministry officials to follow the suggestions of two individuals – a retired senior non-gazetted officer and a chartered accountant – to make last-minute changes in taxation to benefit some business groups. This serious charge against the finance minister got him embroiled in controversy – and lawmakers both from the ruling alliance and opposition sought clarification from the minister in the parliament. Minister Sharma in a press statementrefuted all those allegations as baseless and denied the involvement of those unauthorised individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PM Deuba and other leaders of the ruling coalition should have set up an investigative committee to look into the charge against the finance minister – and let the truth out to the public. This could only be the responsible course of action by the PM as the charges made by the national daily amount to a serious offence, abuse of authority and dereliction of duty on the part of the finance minister. That the PM chose not to do so, raises further questions – if such a move, if any, was carried out in a tacit agreement of the PM. The controversy has put the credibility and accountability of the government at stake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, a leaked audio recording of the conversation between the judge of the Kathmandu district court and a lawyer has exposed deep-rooted corruption within the judiciary.

About sixty-three percent of 17,733,723 registered voters participated in the election to elect 35,221 representatives for 753 local units.As many as seventy-nine political parties and 145,011 contestants competed for various posts, out of which three hundred ninety were elected unopposed.Although there were a few occurrences of violent incidents. The local poll was, in general, free, fair and peaceful across the country. However, owing to logistical challenges, vote counting was sluggish, and the results kept trickling in for the entire second half of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Electoral Coalition paid off for the ruling alliance</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The ruling five-party alliance had forged an electoral alliance for polls in almost one-third of the 753 local units. However, owing to interparty and intraparty disputes about coalition and selection of the consensus candidates, only in twelve of seventy-seven districts, did a full-fledged alliance of the ruling alliance materialise. Despite this, almost all parties of the ruling alliance benefitted from the coalition. The Nepali Congress emerged victorious, winning three hundred and twenty-nine local units. The electoral alliance enabled the NC to gain an edge against its main rival the CPN UML which is now pushed to the distant second position with victories in only two hundred and five local units. Even in the last local election of 2017, the Nepali Congress and the CPN Maoist had forged an election coalition but the CPN UML had still managed to win the largest number of local units. However, this time around, the Nepali Congress has a lead of more than one hundred local units against the CPN UML – and in more than one-third of the local units that Nepali Congress won, it had the backing of other parties in the ruling alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, the CPN Maoist Centre which had been in a steady decline over the years emerged as a formidable political force winning as many as one hundred and twenty-one local units. In more than half of the seats that the CPN Maoist Center won, it was backed by the Nepali Congress and/or other parties of the ruling alliance. The next party of the ruling alliance, the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP), won thirty local units. Although the JSP couldn’t perform at par with the Nepali Congress or the CPN Maoist Center; and performed below expectations even in Madhes – a region where it has a strong foothold – the electoral alliance was still instrumental for the JSP in securing victories in those thirty local units. Likewise, the CPN Unified Socialist – a new party formed by splitting from the CPN UML – won only twenty local units and couldn’t benefit much from the alliance owing to its weak political and organisational base. The leader of the party Madhav Kumar Nepal then accused that the dismal electoral performance had to do with some parties of the ruling alliance not cooperating fully with his party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other side, the CPN UML which had forged an election coalition with some fringe parties performed poorly compared to the local election of 2017. The last time, CPN UML had won two hundred and ninety-four units which got reduced to two hundred and five units in this poll. CPN UML’s performance indicates that a party can’t rely solely on the popularity of a leader – in this case, K P Sharma Oli – to pull off an electoral success. The result also heralds further difficulties for the CPN UML, now that the ruling alliance is more likely to continue with an electoral alliance in both the upcoming provincial and federal elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">CPN UML resorted to the “rigged election” narrative</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Once results started trickling in, and the early trend of the CPN UML performing poorly compared to the Nepali Congress started to emerge, the CPN UML accused the ruling alliance of rigging the election. The UML, on May 14, issued a statement and alleged that the “ruling alliance mobilised bureaucrats, and security personnel in rigging before, during and after the election.” The UML highlighted fifteen different points to support the claim but the fact that the UML chose to wait for the early trend of the election to accuse of rigging “before, during and after the election” is telling in itself. Those accusations don’t hold any ground because it is apparent that the CPN UML chose a convenient narrative of a “rigged election” to justify its poor performance rather than going into the introspection of its shortcomings – the unconstitutional moves of dissolving the lower house twice which had led to the year-long political and constitutional crisis, and its failure to deliver on the front of good governance. And the CPN UML hasn’t even undertaken any legal proceedings for the same. As a party which has led the government a couple of times over the years, the CPN UML should have accepted the defeat in grace as a natural outcome of an electoral contest. However, that it chose not to do so raises questions over the party’s commitment to democratic values and ideals. The communist parties of Nepal, more often than not, have taken refuge in this narrative following poor electoral performances – and such narratives have only added to further corrode the trust of the public in democratic institutions and democratic processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Discontents against the mainstream political parties in a few urban centers</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>In Kathmandu metropolitan city, an independent candidate Balendra Shah (Balen) won the mayoral contest. Similarly, independent candidates Harka Raj Sampang Rai and Gopal Hamal won the post of mayor in Dharan and Dhangadi sub-metropolitan cities respectively. These independent candidates, with no organisational structure and voter base to rely on, outperforming well-established political parties is a new trend that has emerged this election. This is the first time, after the reintroduction of democracy in 1990 that independent candidates have won in major cities. Further, as many as three hundred and eighty-five independent candidates won for different posts across the country. These results are reflective of the discontent of constituents particularly that of the urban educated middle class, against mainstream political parties. Those parties have failed to deliver good governance over the years which has resulted in disillusionment amongst a section of the population. As of now, this trend is confined to a few urban areas but should the mainstream political parties fail to deliver yet again, space for alternative politics is likely to grow in the days to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Issues of local units out of focus in the local polls</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The three tiers of government are envisioned to effectively decentralise the state structure – and therefore during the local polls, issues concerning the effective implementation of the three tiers of government and problems of local bodies should have been in the focus. Likewise, policies about local bodies, issues of corruption and development should have been the factors shaping the results of the local polls. But local polls too were reduced to a mere number and strategy games by the political parties. For the last two months, prospects of coalitions, and inter party, intraparty disputes made the headlines while issues of local bodies were almost completely sidelined. When reduced to mere number games, elections in essence become perfunctory and don’t serve their true purpose. This, however, has been continuing for years ever since the practice of multiparty democracy, and has become one major challenge in Nepal’s transition to democratic maturity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">The budget session of the parliament convened</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>On May 17, the budget session of the parliament convened. The main opposition UML decided to end the obstruction of the parliament after eight long months and allowed the house to function properly. Since last September, the opposition UML had been obstructing the house over the speaker’s refusal to confirm the expulsion of 14 lawmakers of the CPN Unified Socialist – a splinter party of the CPN UML. Through continued obstruction of the house for months, the CPN UML aimed at justifying ex-PM Oli’s unconstitutional move of dissolving the lower house twice by rendering the house dysfunctional. As a consequence, in those eight months, the house had only managed to pass the budgetary bills of the last fiscal year and ratify the MCC compact. Finally, this time around, the CPN UML corrected its course and decided to end the longest ever obstruction in Nepal’s parliamentary history. The poor performance in the local polls could have played part in UML’s decision to let the house function because, unlike the CPN UML’s expectations, the party’s decision to defend unconstitutional moves of dissolving the lower house twice ultimately proved costly even in the polls. With the CPN UML ending its months-long obstruction, the budget session of the parliament ran smoothly and held deliberations over the upcoming budget.

Never formally colonized, Nepali people appear extra possessive towards their country’s natural heritages and historical richness and have a strong emotional attachment. Therefore, any sort of attack on Mt. Everest and Gautam Buddha, for instance, quickly flares up people’s sentiments and aggression. Given these dynamics, India’s perceived bossiness and occasional border conflicts often invite a huge national outburst. This was seen in the most recent India-Nepal border conflict in the Kalapani region, where all the political parties came forward to support the government’s unilateral action of publishing a new map and amending the constitution.[1] However, the government’s reluctance to confront the northern neighbor despite repeated complaints of encroachment begs the question of the ruling party’s true attitude and the intention.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Source of the Conflict</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue of border encroachment by China in Humla surfaced when locals of Namkha Rural Municipality reported to the District Administration Office of nine new Chinese construction in Nepali land between the Pillars 11 and 12. The chair of Namkha, Bishnu Bahadur Tamang, claimed that Nepal’s territory “extends two kilometers north from where the buildings are.”[2] Responding to the locals, the assistant Chief District Officer (CDO), Dattaraj Hamal, made an initial visit to the area. Later, the Home Ministry sent a team of government officials, security personnel, and local representatives—led by Humla’s CDO Chiranjibi Giri—to inspect the situation and report to the government. The initial problem seemed to be the missing Pillar no. 11, which was “damaged during a road construction on the Nepali territory some 12 years back.”[3] Locals believed that drawing a straight line between Pillars 11 and 12 would easily show that the new Chinese constructions were in the Nepali territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reportedly, the Chinese officials at the border had denied the possibility of any talks and had stressed that the constructions were on Chinese land. Even the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, Zang Si, falsified the ‘accusations’ of Chinese encroachment and instead accused Indian media of sensationalizing the issue. Interestingly, the border inspection team found the missing Pillar 11 in Ward No. 6 of the rural municipality in Takule,[4] and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quick to issue a statement confirming that “the said buildings are not located within the Nepali territory.”[5] Referring to an inter-ministerial field inspection in 2016 on the same issue, the ministry clarified that the team had concluded the said buildings to be “located one kilometer inside the Chinese territory from the Nepal-India border.”[6] According to the government, Nepal did not have a border conflict with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Field Investigation by Jiwan Bahadur Shahi</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepali Congress (NC)’s Central Committee member and Provincial Lawmaker, Jiwan Bahadur Shahi, was cynical of the government’s rushed conclusion. Therefore, Shahi, who is also a resident of Humla, led his own team to Humla for further investigation. After an 11-day study from Pillar 5 to Pillar 12,[7] Shahi’s team came up with some crucial findings, which led the opposition Nepali Congress to conclude that China has, indeed, encroached on Nepali land in Humla.[8] Shahi’s team concluded the following[9]:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Chinese constructions in Lolungjong near Pillar no. 12 are in Nepali territory.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The investigation team concluded that the new Chinese buildings in Lolungjong are in Nepali territory and that Pillar no. 12 lies to the north of the constructions. In addition, local residents claim that they went to Lolungjong for livestock farming and cattle grazing. The hard evidence of the pillar’s location in reference to the Chinese buildings and local’s account of their lifestyle in the region suggest at least a possibility of encroachment, which requires further bilateral investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Shahi’s team found that the Pillar no. 12 was newly constructed. The apparent changed-orientation of the pillar, new fonts on it, and scattered remains of the old pillar indicated that the Chinese side had unilaterally built the new pillar, without Nepal government’s knowledge. If so, it violates the international as well as bilateral protocols of border management—an agreement Nepal and China signed in 1960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Fig 2 below shows, although the printed date of 2018 B.S. (1962) is supposed to indicate the year the pillar was built, the color, font, and its overall status clearly indicate that it was built recently. If the government of Nepal has no knowledge of it, it is crucial to investigate what happened with the old pillar and who built the new one. Why was it done unilaterally?</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>China has encroached Nepali land in Kith, Hilsa</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Shahi’s team found that “China has also encroached Nepali territory near the border pillars 5(1) and 5(2) in the Kith area, and removed the old Junge Pillar no 5(2).”[11] The report also states that Nepalese are restricted from entering and using their ‘registered’ land in Kith. Even security personnel are restricted to inspect the pillar.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>China has constructed fences in the no-man’s-land of Hilsa</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shahi-led investigation found China to have violated the international obligation “by constructing a gate in between the Pillar 9(2) in no man’s land at the Hilsa border area.”[12] Again, this unilateral act requires Nepal government’s attention and China’s clarification on why the gate has been constructed in the no-man’s-land.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>No encroachment around Pillars 10 and 11</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Shahi’s team found that there was no encroachment around the Pillars 10 and 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Discussion and Conclusion</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>China has continued to play with Nepali people’s sentiments, albeit subtly. Be it the unilateral measurement of Mt. Everest or the occasional claims over it, China has had an eagle eye on Nepal’s northern frontier and its glorious mountains. If it were not for its volatile Tibet region, which requires Nepal’s commitment to the one-China policy, China would most certainly have a bossier attitude towards Nepal and its northern territory. Nevertheless, China has occasionally projected its expansionist attitude to Nepal. Sadly, Nepal’s ruling communist party has remained worryingly silent on such occasions. The border encroachment in Humla is one such example, where the ruling NCP government rushed to falsify the locals’ claims instead of initiating a joint investigation and questioning the Chinese moves. As former Foreign Minister and NC leader Dr. Prakash Sharan Mahat dubs it, the NCP government’s silence on this issue is “irresponsible.”[13]</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Time-line of major events</h2>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Year</th>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Event</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>1955</td>\r\n			<td>Nepal-China diplomatic relations formally begin</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>20 April 1960</td>\r\n			<td>Anti-China protests led by NC</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>21 March 1960</td>\r\n			<td>Border agreement between China and Nepal</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>1960</td>\r\n			<td>Nepal China Joint Boundary Commission formed</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>5 October 1961</td>\r\n			<td>Nepal China Boundary Treaty signed by King Mahendra</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>1979</td>\r\n			<td>First Joint Border Inspection</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>1989</td>\r\n			<td>Second Joint Border Inspection</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>2006</td>\r\n			<td>Third Joint Border Inspection</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>2016</td>\r\n			<td>Locals of the Lapcha-Lolung region demand border supervision for the first time after Chinese constructions were built between pillars 11 and 12.

Based on the report, the opposition Nepali Congress has officially concluded that China has indeed encroached on Nepali land in Humla. However, the NCP government seems totally uninterested in antagonizing its communist neighbor in the north by questioning any of its moves. Instead, the NCP appears more concerned with maintaining its relationship with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by comfortably overlooking Nepal’s national interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the above timeline shows, there has been no joint border inspection since 2006. While the local residents are repeatedly claiming that China has encroached on Nepali land and when the opposition Nepali Congress already stands behind the locals with concrete proofs, the ruling party should show seriousness for the border issue in the north and work for the national interest of the country.

While SPP began as a humanitarian and disaster response training program, according to the national guard website, SPP is a “partner focused, strategically aligned” program administered by the National Guard Bureau of the United States that conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals becoming a key U.S. security cooperation tool, facilitating cooperation across all aspects of international civil-military affairs and encouraging people-to-people ties at the state level”. “The program has a focus on disaster response, aviation safety and operations, leadership development, military medical fields, and cyber defense, etc.” All hell broke loose when the Commanding General of the US Army Pacific Charles Flynn encouraged Nepal to become a part of the program in his meetings with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Nepal Army chief General Prabhu Ram Sharma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While media reports stated “both parties were seeking a broader political consensus for signing the agreement”, news of a possible military cooperation between Nepal and the United States spread like wildfire, triggering debates over sovereignty and national integrity. The arguments around the SPP are reminiscent to the MCC compact; with people questioning whether Nepal joining the SPP would make it a part of the United States’ military alliance under the Indo-Pacific Strategy. While some have argued that agreeing to become a part of the SPP could have long term implications on Nepal’s national security and sovereignty, others argue that the program is being unnecessarily politicized when these forms of military agreements between Nepal and the United States are a continuation of bilateral engagements that have existed for decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The incoherence among statements made by parties involved has also emerged as a strategic fault on Nepal’s part. While the Minister for Home Affairs swiftly denied the claims and said that “Nepal is not involved in the SPP in any way nor does it have any intention to do so in the future”, the United States Embassy in Nepal followed with a statement clarifying that the SPP is not a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, however maintaining that Nepal had actually applied for the program and it was not a proposal. Nepal Army, refuted embassy claims and issued a statement outlining that it had never entered any such agreement with the US Military. However, a leaked letter published by Kantipur revealed that Nepali Army had initiated a request to be included in the United States’ State Partnership Program in 2015 making a request to then American Ambassador to Nepal, Alaina B. Teplitz in the backdrop of the disastrous earthquake of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fractious politicians of Nepal have found yet another opportunity for blame games and one-upmanship amidst the controversy. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has maintained that the government would not sign into effect any agreement that had the potential to harm Nepal. However, leaders of the ruling coalition have put blame on CPN-UML for agreeing to be a part of the program, while UML leaders have blamed Nepali Congress for making the request when it was in charge and pushing Nepal into a geopolitical difficulty. The lack of expert discussions, inter agency coordination, and broad consensus on foreign policy across parties has caused major blows to Nepal international credibility. In what has become another political blunder for Nepal, the incident has exposed the duplicity of Nepali leaders’ and called into question the coordination, transparency and accountability of government institutions. In addition, the politicization of the involvement of Nepal Army has caused damage to the institution’s otherwise stable reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The politicization of SPP could cause strain in Nepal- US ties that had only just recovered after the ratification of the highly politicized MCC that was a cause of great frustration for the United States.

The document has highlighted ten major areas for improvement including policy and legal reform, peace, security and crime control, institutional reforms and physical infrastructure, disaster management, and good governance among others. Under the policy and legal reform section, one of the actions that is outlined is drafting of a Border Security Act which is planned to be completed in a year. Nepal Armed Police Force along with the Home Ministry will be responsible for drafting the act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan to draft a Border Security Act comes after 20 years of drafting the Armed Police Act 2058 through which the Armed Police Force (APF) was assigned with protecting international borders. Similarly, the National Security Policy stipulates that Nepal Army is tasked with defending Nepal’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity from external infiltration and aggression. Although there are different organizations deployed for the protection of borders, there is no separate legal apparatus that binds these organizations together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The news comes at a time when Nepal is having border issues with both India and China. One of the reasons for the ongoing border disputes with China is the lack of proper surveillance of the border pillars. Similarly, the open border between Nepal and India poses security concerns for Nepal like human and goods trafficking, smuggling, and unchecked migration. According to K.C. (2019), smuggling and illegal cross border activities have increased over the years. Although National Security Policy encompasses certain aspects of borders, border security primarily focuses on territorial integrity. Thus, a separate legal document concerning border security is important in addressing these issues. Apart from the act, the ministry is also planning to prepare a digital profile of border posts between India and China within the next two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To strengthen the border security of the country, the document proposes to increase the number of APF personnel in accordance with the international standards and improve the existing infrastructure. A recent news regarding the lack of infrastructure for the APF personnel deployed at the Border Outpost (BOP) in Hilsa is indicative of the need to strengthen the existing infrastructure of APF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the plan put forth by the ministry is important in addressing some of the pressing issues of the country, it is also very ambitious. For instance, the development of a software for thermal customized tracking system to monitor people and vehicular cross-border movement will require integrated planning and infrastructure. Amidst the political turmoil in the country, it will be interesting to observe how these plans will be implemented effectively.</p>', NULL, 2808, NULL, NULL, 'Yunish Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670582473_DaneBohara_Simikot_RSS_28-2048x1152.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-02-24', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 22:25:24', '2022-12-09 22:32:42'),

Even though Russia and Ukraine have been at war since 2014, Russia has now entered Ukraine for the past 5 weeks using military force. Many are killed, infrastructures destroyed and now an attack on Mariupol is ongoing. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has shaken the whole world. More than 4 million Ukrainians who have fled are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. The western nations have condemned and imposed sanctions retaliating against the devasting invasion of Russia on Ukraine. The embargoes and sanctions have been escalated over the past few weeks to discourage Russia from further invasion. The USA, UK and many western countries have cut off gas and oil supply from Russia, Russia’s assets are frozen, excluded from their financial systems, bans on Russian flights. Until March 24, additional sanctions by the US in collaboration with the EU and the G-7, targeting members of the parliament and additional individuals, are imposed. Yet, Putin has not budged the slightest and has shown no intentions of withdrawing his military from the Ukrainian territory. If the war is prolonged the whole world will see impacts on the global economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government of Nepal has already voiced against the atrocities of Russia, even, voted in favour of the UN resolution to condemn it. India and China have stated neutrality on the matter. Then why would Nepal, a non-aligned committed nation take a side in the war? Nepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Khadka in an interview stated that “We stand for human rights, peaceful co-existence of small nations and the UN charter,” and further elaborated, “Respecting the idea of non-alignment policy does not mean that we are associated with one particular camp.” Nepal believes in Human Rights and condemns matters that challenge international peace and security; invasion against any nation is condemned by the UN charter which Nepal has been a member of since 1955. Taking no sides would also imply the “Might is right” narrative, which a country like Nepal situated in between two emerging powers comprehends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the western world has seen a direct impact on the economy, Nepal still falls victim to the impact of sanctions imposed by the western world. Over the past few weeks, fuel prices have increased drastically; within the time period of 3 weeks, the prices have risen from 133rs/l to 150rs/l. This is expected to increase even more and a new list of petroleum prices has been increased to 155Rs/l on March 16 as mentioned in the press release of Nepal Oil Corporation. Moreover, on 29th March Nepal Oil Corporation has sent a proposal to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, proposing added public holidays on Sunday, an odd-even rule on vehicles, government reduction of customs duty on fuel to manage shortage and adverse impact of the increase in fuel prices. Deputy Director-General of Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) Gokarna Awasthi said the Ukraine-Russia crisis would weaken Nepal’s economic growth and quicken inflation. Inflation has increased and is estimated to increase by two digits as for now it has increased to 5.65 but may reach 10% if the Russia-Ukraine extends a few more weeks, production costs, transportation costs will spike up where consumers will be highly impacted by it. The Central bank of Nepal through a research study on ‘The Impact of Food Inflation on Poverty in Nepal’ has predicted that the 10% rise in inflation in Nepal will push additional 100,000 people into poverty and 180,000 additional people into food poverty. This is a dire situation for Nepal to be in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal has trade and diplomatic relationship with Ukraine since 1993. As of 2020, according to the direction of trade statistics reported by the International Monetary Fund, Nepal’s export is 0.02 million and 202 million spent on imports. Hence, the direct impact on the economy by the conflict is estimated to be minimal. Even though the import and export trade with Ukraine is not as distinct, the war has affected the rate of commodities that are exported from Ukraine and Russia. As reported in Rising Nepal Daily, “Director of Pashupati Edible Oil Industry Amit Sarda informed that loading and shipment from both the countries have been stopped now.” This will mount to the shortage in goods such as ghee and oil, making the costs of these goods increase in the market. Since the war has disrupted the global supply chain and promoted the increase in costs, it will indirectly affect the economy of Nepal as well. If the cost of merchandise persists to upsurge in the international market, Nepal has to use the foreign currency reserves to meet the import demands of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal during the pandemic has already suffered from severe damage to the economy and intensified poverty as many lost jobs, industries were shut down, markets were closed, borders were stringent for trade. Now was the time for Nepal to escalate its economic growth of the country. It is high time for the country to focus on internal resource management and the growth of industries and production within the country. Time and again in various ways Nepal has had to face scarcity of goods and products as during the earthquake devastation, blockades, pandemic and now Russia and Ukraine war supplementing the situation for economic loss. The cascading economy of the country throughout these events should be a great lesson for the country to seek out new possibilities to fulfil the gaps of goods and reduce the inflation rate. Alternative sources should be sought out. Oil prices are flaring up; hence, Nepal should limit its petroleum usage and shift to renewable energies. Heavy investments in the hydropower sector are needed to reach its optimum production level. Nepal being an import-based country needs to act rapidly and be perceptive in improving the home production of goods.

The unseasonal rain which started in the third week of October displaced hundreds of families. Due to rising water levels, 42 out of 56 gates of Koshi barrage were opened. The people living around the area were warned to remain vigilant of the possible flooding risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rainfall destroyed the paddy crops in several parts of the country, especially on several districts of Sudurpaschim, Lumbini, Karnali and Gandaki provinces. According to the estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, the damages to the paddy crops could be around NRS 8.26 billion. The heavy losses in rice production could shave up to 0.6 percentage of GDP. Apart from the damages to the paddy crops, the production of other vegetables has also been affected which has resulted in price hikes. The loss in the production of paddy crops could also see an increase in the prices of rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Lack of preparedness</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with warnings and cautions from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), concerned authorities seemed lax in their approach and preparation regarding the weather change and the heavy rainfall. Furthermore, the information regarding the post-monsoon rainfall also failed to reach the farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal is prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and wildfires, while climate change has made the extreme weather conditions more frequent and unpredictable. Although these events cannot be stopped, certain measures can be taken to be better prepared for the disasters. One of the ways is through early warning systems to predict the instances of extreme weather conditions. However, Nepal lacks advanced technology of early warning systems and there is also a weak coordination between different disaster related agencies and non-governmental organizations working in disaster preparedness work. The Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Act was passed in 2017 to oversee the management of all kinds of disasters. However, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council still doesn’t exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Short term relief over long term disaster management</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Natural Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, which operates under the Home Ministry prepared an Early Preparedness and Response Work Plan 2021 to lessen the impacts of monsoon rains. However, experts have criticized that the preparations for pre-disaster are minimal and most of its focus is oriented towards post disaster response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has focused on token relief measures, which shifts the focus away from long term disaster management. Despite this, the use of government aid for the affected communities hasn’t been effective. According to a survey funded by the UN, only 39 percent of the flood victims believe that the government fund is reaching the affected communities. In case of crops damage, farmers are required to show proof of land ownership to claim the government aid. Under this policy, the tenant farmers are barred from using the aid. A recent report highlighted that the government has failed to distribute relief fund worth NRS 25 million to the landslide victims of Jure. The failure of the government to distribute the fund to the victims means that the fund has been sitting in the account of Disaster Management Fund for seven years. Although President Bidya Devi Bhandari has summoned officials at the agriculture ministry to take account of the current situation and prepare for relief distribution and measures, the victims are least hopeful of getting compensated or relieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', NULL, 2808, NULL, NULL, 'Yunish Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670583195_BBB-Doti-NapaniSadak.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-11-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 22:38:15', '2022-12-09 22:41:56'),

Oli’s political endgame is not clear; it has brought into play internal political conflict, foreign actors and forces that are eager to disrupt the constitution. In order to attain political stability, it may be necessary to think of a new political conclusion: We have to move beyond the idea of political stability to the idea of constitutional stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Sources of instability</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary cause of political conflict in Nepal is the difference in privileges and benefits enjoyed by those in power and those outside. It is not just about power, but the power to abuse authority and to grift with impunity. The gap between the haves and have nots—in terms of their ability to steal money and privileges from the state—breeds a level of resentment that motivates political actors to develop cliques and go to extremes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, individuals driven by dogmatic egos and a sense of grievance have disrupted the nation’s political course and destroyed the dreams of multiple generations. The Maoist conflict, for example, was driven by two dogmatic individuals, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai, and Nepal wasted almost 15 years in needless conflict, which otherwise could have led to the evolution of democratic culture and economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stakes are raised higher because of the play by foreign countries like India, China and the United States who prioritise their own strategic interests over the interests of the Nepali people. Then there are the cleavages based on identity, feelings for monarchy, religion, class and resistance to the idea of federalism. These divisions undermine constitutional stability and promote mistrust of the current political design. But most importantly, there is a significant gap between the existing political culture and the fundamental principles of democracy like accountability and separation of powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of now, there is too much uncertainty about Nepal’s political course. The obvious first question is whether the Supreme Court will restore Parliament, and even if it is restored, whether it will be able to form a government. Another uncertainty is the timing and possibility of elections under different scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major actors at the moment are the political parties, civil society, state institutions and foreign countries. The level of conflict and relationship among these different actors—including the level of geopolitical conflict—will shape Nepal’s future political course; it could lead to anything between an emergency government riddled with political conflict to a relatively smooth transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in order for Nepal to enjoy peace and stability, constitutionalism must be resilient and strong. Whether Nepal will enjoy stability or not also depends on whether constitutionalism will prevail or not, which in turn could depend on the role of civil society and demands for rewriting the constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is now time to think about constitutional stability, rather than political stability. Constitutional stability emerges only when we are able to address relations of power between different historical forces and the socio-cultural factors that shape the nature of such political conflict. These include the norms and boundaries of conflict. For example, if people do not have a habit of following constitutional norms, it is very difficult for the constitution alone to deliver democracy. It will require appropriate checks and balances between different political forces, and rewards for abiding by the constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some constitutional experts are proposing the need to review the existing constitution by creating a commission to look into how it can be rewritten in order to address factors of political instability and extra-constitutionalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Questions about foreign policy</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although KP Oli appears to have gone against Chinese interests by dissolving Parliament, splitting the party and announcing elections, his faction still has an affinity for the Chinese. This is evident from the language used in speeches, government policy documents and political culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal, the Communist Party of China has been eager to develop closer party-to-party relations and provide ‘experience’ about governance. This was re-emphasised by Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday. With the visit of the Chinese president, Nepal and China had formally entered into what the Chinese have described as a ‘strategic’ level of partnership, beyond the previous state-to-state relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has now become obvious that geopolitical competition between India, US and China has spilled over into Nepal’s domestic politics. Internal political stability, therefore, requires a healthy foreign policy that can limit the role of foreign actors in Nepal’s internal political competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The country needs to have a transparent foreign policy with clearly stated objectives that not only Nepal but also foreign countries can agree on. At the moment, there is a big gap between Nepal’s stated foreign policy goals and actual practices. Nepal’s foreign policy uses language and tones influenced by and favourable to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gap exists because Nepal’s foreign policy is more a tool for the ruling political faction than the country as a whole. In the last few years, for example, KP Oli has been using Nepal’s foreign policy as a tool to consolidate his power over his rivals rather than as a tool to promote Nepal’s national interests. This is another reason that invites intrusive countermeasures from within the ruling political parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal and external factors imply that in order to attain constitutional stability, Nepal may need to emphasise a new type of political culture, forge a higher level understanding about foreign policy, start a new dialogue process, and most importantly, rewrite the constitution itself. It is, therefore, time to move beyond the idea of political stability to the idea of constitutional stability.</p>\r\nThis article appeared in The Kathmandu Post on December 30, 2020.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/12/29/time-to-rewrite-the-constitution</span></p>', NULL, 2808, NULL, NULL, 'Ajaya Bhadra Khanal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670583755_flag-2528941_1280.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12', '2020-12-31', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 22:47:35', '2022-12-09 22:48:49');

This is the first time in 17 years where a human rights commissioner will be visiting China. The last visit was took place on 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to spokesperson for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, the purpose of the visit of the high commissioner for human rights is to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides. Xinjiang province is an internal matter of China, it has always opposed the interference of external forces citing “political manipulation”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the administration of President Xi Jinping, China is allegedly running a campaign of mass detention re-education, and religious and cultural oppression of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. Though denied by China, the ground reports done by media groups such as The Guardian, Washington Post, BBC etc allege the existence of detention camps in the region. Furthermore, Beijing has stepped up its crackdown on civil society by tightening restrictions on freedom of speech since 2012. According to China, the crackdown in Xinjiang is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism and the camps are an effective tool for re-educating inmates in its fight against terrorism. The Government of China, in its wisdom, has placed the media, foreign journalists, internet services and mobile phones of the Xinjiang province under heavy surveillance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Xinjiang Province</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Xinjiang province is an autonomous region in Northwest China wherein 40 ethnic groups reside. But its administration model is similar to that of Tibet which is controlled by the Chinese Communist party. There are two major ethnic groups that reside in this region namely Uyghur Muslims and Han Chinese. The other ethnicities residing in this region include Hui Muslims, Mongolians, Khalkas, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Tatars, Russians etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue between the Han Chinese and the Uighurs is decades old but gained traction and world attention post 2009. It is alleged that due to extreme policies of the CCP, attacks on the Uighurs increased from 2010 onwards to such an extent that it escalated into a global human rights issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2018, the United Human Rights Panel revealed that China has 1 million Uighur Muslims in counter extremism centers, which they called ‘detention camps’ against the claims of the Chinese government which terms these as ‘vocational training centers’. China’s counterterrorism measures include enhanced security and what China calls vocational training and education centres which is vital for the global fight against terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times [The Xinjiang Papers: ‘Absolutely No Mercy’: Leaked Files expose how china organized mass detentions of Muslims; Author Austin Ramzy &amp; Chris Buckley; Nov 16 2019]: on 16th November 2019, New York Times claimed that it discovered a 400 page secret document that was indicative of an unprecedented crackdown on the ethnic minorities of the Xinjiang region. These documents refer to the centers as schools but allege that activities carried out in such schools amounts to human rights violations based on media reports, testimonies and evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">What is the Conflict About?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An estimated 10 million Uighurs reside in the Autonomous region of Xinjiang. Additionally, in the early 21st century, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan accounted for another 300,000 Uighurs. The prevalent language of Uighurs is part of the Altaic language group which includes Turkic, Mongolian among others. They are also the oldest Turkic speaking people in the region and find mention in records as old as 3rd century CE but their prominence was seen in the 8th century CE when they established their own Kingdom near the Orkhon river. In terms of modern day geography, this region falls under North-Central Mongolia. Due to historical attacks by contemporary Mongols and Kyrgys, the group was displaced from this region into Xinjiang and other regions. Around the 10th century CE, they accepted Islam as their religion and nearly 80% of modern Uighurs belong to the Sunni sect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question that arises is why China seeks to control this region when it is designated as an Autonomous Region. The Uighur Autonomous region of Xinjiang is a part of China that shares its borders with – Qinghai and Gansu provinces of China on the east; Tibet on the south; Afghanistan and Kashmir on the south-west; Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan on the west; Kazakhstan on the north-west; Russia on the north and Mongolia on the north-east. It also happens to be the largest political unit of China having its capital at Urumqi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 20th Century, the conflicts between the Han Chinese and Uighurs saw a manifold increase, effects of which were seen in the first decade of the 21st Century as well. After the Chinese revolution in 1912, Xinjiang Province was captured by the Turkic Commander Yang Zengxin who was appointed Governor by the Beijing Government. He was later assassinated in 1928 following which the region was administered by Jin Shuren and Sheng Shicai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in 1949, after the victory of the CCP, the Central Government implemented liberal policies in the region and it was declared ‘Autonomous’ in 1955. In the following years, from 1958 to 1960, a campaign called the “Great Leap Forward” was initiated by the CCP with a view to organize the entire population of China. This entailed large-scale rural communes which, according to the CCP, were necessary to solve industrial and agricultural problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thereafter, between 1966 and 1976, Mao Zedong started the ‘Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution’ (GPCR) in order to distinguish the Chinese Model of revolution from that of the Soviets. This pushed many regions of China including Xinjiang into turmoil. The resulting food shortage coupled with strained Sino-Soviet ties through the 1960s led to a mass exodus of kazakhs from China into Kazakhstan which was then a part of the Soviet Union. This in turn led to political instability in the region and ethnic tensions in the border regions grew. By the end of GPCR, Xinjiang had developed economically and many Han Chinese chose to immigrate into the region thereby resulting in a demographic change. After the CCP came to power in China, many changes were implemented one of which included a subtle change in demography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is pertinent to note that the Uyghur constituted 75% of the total population in the 1950s. Han Chinese– the country’s majority ethnic group constituted for just 6.2% (currently 42% Uyghur; Han Chinese 40%). One of the alleged reasons behind such a decline in Uyghur population is religious persecution. Therefore, owing to changes in demography, policies and government’s approach, economic disparities emerged between the Han Chinese and Uighurs which further fuelled ethic divides leading to protests and other disturbances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juy 2009 saw a violet outbreak in Urumqi in which an estimated 200 people died mostly Han Chinese. Twelve Uyghurs were killed by Chinese security forces and another nine were executed several months later. It is after this event that this far western Xinjiang region witnessed a considerable increase in violent outbreaks amongst the 2 ethnic groups which have been reported on multiple occasions in the last decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CCP blames the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) which has also been designated by the US State Department as “the most militant of the ethnic Uighur separatist groups.” On 5, 2020, the Trump administration delisted ETIM as a terrorist group. ETIM, however, has never accepted responsibility for these attacks. Consequently, the CCP, working under the suspicion that Uighurs are dissidents and separatists, began cracking down on them. Until 2017, the action taken by the authorities included shootings, arrests and long jail sentences. Post 2017, citing security reasons, China increased surveillance and crackdown measures in this region especially with the Uighur ethnic groups. According to the allegations in the leaked document of the New York Times, these measures are said to have come directly from the desk of the President (“respond with no mercy” order).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">How the world sees it?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Xinjiang and its constituent demography has evolved into a geopolitical issue of significance for USA and a politically sensitive one for China. In 2018, the Human Rights panel of the UN had claimed of possessing evidence indicating the presence of detention camps in the Xinjiang Region. In 2020, the US enacted the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act that mandates several US government bodies to report on the issues of Human Rights violations of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Only recently, in a coordinated effort, the EU, UK, US and Canada, passed a resolution imposing sanctions on China for her Human Rights violations in Xinjiang.</p>', NULL, 2801, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1670584048_image-20161006-14709-x8dkll-1140x855-1.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-05', '2022-05-04', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 22:52:28', '2022-12-09 23:07:24'),

As the Nepali citizens get increasingly desperate to return, they await a less than warm welcome back home. The government struggles to finalize a location to quarantine them as WTO guidelines suggest that returning individuals remain under quarantine for a 14-day observation period to minimize the risk of the virus spreading.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Social Media and Beyond</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter is also abuzz with tweets from people based within and beyond Wuhan. Rastraraj Bhandari, a Nepali student based in China has likened his experience during this time to that of a ‘post-zombie apocalyptic breakout’. He details this with accounts of going onto empty streets, stocking up on market supplies and otherwise remaining confined to his home, and relying on instant noodles for meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pressure to rescue Nepali citizens mounted after other countries including India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka evacuated their citizens from China.[iii] According to the Ministry of Health, isolating those coming into Nepal from the epicenter of the virus has become increasingly unavoidable after a case of the novel coronavirus infection was confirmed in Nepal, followed by a declaration of the virus being a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 31, 2019. Nepalis back home also fear that if the evacuees are released without being quarantined and subsequently cleared, homes could also become incubators for the disease to spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">What is Nepal Government doing?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During this time, the Nepal government established screening centers and health desks at the airport as screening is the only way of identifying the maximum number of cases entering the country and prevent exposing and infecting the population. However, while a location to quarantine those being evacuated from Hubei is being finalized,[iv] Nepal’s only international airport is neither quarantining nor screening passengers travelling from other parts of China with no maintenance of passenger records. The land borders however have been closed. One cannot help but wonder if they are in fact coming to a safer environment or diving headfirst into precariousness. This has further exposed how off guard the Nepali authorities appear in the face of an emergency and how Nepal lacks any strategy to contain such crisis situations. [v]</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Has Nepal prepared itself to repatriate its citizens from China?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Research suggests that acute and chronic changes in health status have direct and indirect impacts on security and that epidemics may lead to destabilization, political unrest, civil disorder, or long term deterioration of the economic viability of a country or region. Coronavirus which originated from Wuhan is increasingly taking the form of a pandemic and has even been declared a worldwide threat by the WHO. Ineffective responses to such diseases will have devastating impacts on public health initially and on the global economy in the long run. Like during most crisis conditions, there seem to be more unknowns than knowns. The Nepali citizens are reportedly being airlifted on February 15, 2020, while Nepali authorities scramble to appropriate conditions and kits for quarantine. Nonetheless, when it comes to the coronavirus or any other looming disasters, Nepal is unprepared to handle them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Author: Shuvangi Poudyal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo: Pixabay</p>\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">[i] https://www.nepalisansar.com/health/180-nepalis-appeal-for-evacuation-from-china/</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">[ii] https://english.khabarhub.com/2020/04/73170/</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">[iii] https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/quarantine-location-to-be-finalised-today/</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">[iv] https://kathmandupost.com/2/2020/02/04/government-focuses-on-nepalis-in-hubei-but-travellers-from-rest-of-china-are-neither-screened-nor-quarantined</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">[v] https://www.ibtimes.com/coronavirus-update-nepal-prepares-fly-citizens-home-china-trade-ties-shut-down-2914763</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/01/17/chinese-man-quarantined-with-coronavirus-under-observation-in-kathmandu-officials-confirm</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">https://www.hamropatro.com/news/details/5752818604310528?ns=</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/01/29/coronavirus-what-are-symptoms-of-wuhan-china-novel-virus/4563892002/</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/25/c_138732435.htm</span></p>', NULL, 2808, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670584277_coronavirus-4833754_1280.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-02', '2020-02-13', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 22:56:17', '2022-12-09 22:59:44'),

However, looking at the decreasing rate of incoming tourists in 2019, the campaign may be at a great disadvantage. The tourist growth was merely 2 percent last year. For the campaign to be successful, the rate of tourist growth needs to reach an overambitious target of 70 percent. A series of unfortunate events that occurred in the first month of the campaign could propagate subsequent failure and further disappointment.</p>\r\n<p>A total of 995,884 foreigners and 1,252,236 Nepalis arrived at TIA while another 209,365 arrived through land, of which 201,307 were foreigners. The share of foreigners is roughly 49 percent of the arrivals. The total number of flights arriving at TIA per day in January 2020 was 32. Assuming an average passenger count of 200 per carrier, the total number for the year can be 2,336,000 (6,400 per day). At 49 percent arrival rate of foreigners, the target of two million tourists will be doomed as it requires an increment of 70 percent growth over 2019. This growth requires 700,000 more tourists coming by air. For bringing additional tourists, there need to be more flights; 3500 per year i.e. nine more planes arriving at TIA per day carrying only foreigners, which is next to impossible. Also, from the above data, it is safe to say that Nepal needs 18 more airplanes per day to maintain the foreign and Nepali ratio. Technically, it seems impossible to bring two million tourists this year. </p>\r\n<p>What’s more, a series of missteps have further jeopardised the prospect of attracting a record number of tourists this year. Nepal Tourism Board began its campaign for Visit Nepal 2020, but the organisation was without a head for until the last week of January. Dhananjaya Regmi was appointed the CEO of Nepal Tourism Board after the position had lain vacant for more than a month. A crucial month for the campaign was put in jeopardy due to the delay. </p>\r\n<p>Likewise, Nepal Airlines Corporation has faced hindrances over the past few years. The procurement of new aircraft was obscure, which raised suspicions of corruption. Following the allegations on Sugat Ratna Kanaskar, Madan Kharel was appointed to the post of Executive Chairman to drag NAC out of the pit. However, Kharel resigned on January 19 citing lack of cooperation from the NAC Board. His resignation could hinder the campaign since the number of destinations NAC is serving at the moment will remain stagnant. </p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of the year, Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai’s Visit Nepal rally in Sydney was condemned for being insensitive and inappropriate. On January 21, eight Indians were found dead at Everest Panorama Resort, Daman due to asphyxiation. This incident highlighted the shortcomings in the hospitality sector and their incapability to handle emergencies. After six hours of anticipation, the tourists were airlifted back to Kathmandu; there was no emergency medical support on-site. When the Ministry announced the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign, did the government bother to monitor whether the necessary infrastructure was available? </p>\r\n<p>With the VNY 2020, the majority of tourists are expected to come from India. However, following the ban on Indian public vehicles in Pokhara, the number of Indians travelling to Nepal may subside. The ban was imposed citing traffic congestion and the visitors’ unawareness of traffic rules. The Ministry said they will lift the ban once the traffic is under control, but no announcement has been made yet. Besides, the ban was imposed to promote local transportation in Pokhara. The authorities can alternatively lift the ban and impose taxes on the Indian cars that enter Nepal. This measure will not discourage tourists while also collecting revenue. </p>\r\n<p>Similarly, four Koreans and three Nepalis went missing while trekking in the Annapurna Base Camp circuit, after an avalanche hit the region. The rescue was hampered by heavy snowfall, and search operations were called off. A major tourist attraction for Nepal is its trekking routes; however, due to lack of security measures and uncalled natural calamities, like the avalanche, trekkers are discouraged from going on expeditions. The ministry could ban trekking during the offseason as an additional security measure. </p>\r\n<p>As if all these incidents were not enough, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus in China has claimed the lives of many. China is Nepal’s second-largest source market, but the following the epidemic and a travel ban, the campaign has already seen a roadblock in bringing tourists from China. Nepal was targeting 350,000 tourists from China this year. The official decision to impose travel restriction will sharply decelerate Chinese tourists, at least until the virus is contained. But hotel occupancy rates have already plummeted. </p>\r\n<p>In 2011, the country had targeted one million tourists as part of the Visit Nepal campaign then. However, they were only able to meet 80 percent of the target. It took almost a decade to cross the one million mark. The government’s plan to double the tourist numbers within two years of reaching that one million mark seems farfetched. </p>\r\n<p>Nepal’s infrastructure was never prepared to host and accommodate two million tourists. Hotel rooms are not enough to ensure two million tourists. Furthermore, not having enough aircraft to bring in the targeted tourists is like counting your chickens before they are hatched. Given the series of events in January, the chances of Visit Nepal 2020 being successful are very slim. </p>\r\n<p>Author: Shraddha More</p>\r\n<p>Photo: Pixabay</p>\r\n<p>This article was first published in The Kathmandu Post on February 9, 2020</p>', NULL, 2808, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670584741_gokyo-ri-4692458_1280.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-02', '2020-02-13', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 23:04:01', '2022-12-09 23:04:01'),

Major political parties of the likes of Nepali Congress, CPN UML, CPN Maoist Centre and CPN Unified Socialist published their election manifestos. Although federalism is envisioned also to promote inclusivity, the major political parties have yet again failed to ensure proportional representation of the women, janajatis, dalits and other marginalised communities, particularly in candidates’ selection for the federal and provincial first-past-the-post (FPTP) polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Timeline of Major Events</h2>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Date</th>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Event</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>October 8</td>\r\n			<td>Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) left the ruling electoral alliance and joined the alliance of the CPN UML and RPP.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>October 9</td>\r\n			<td>Candidates filed their candidacy nominations for Federal and Provincial FPTP polls.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>October 10</td>\r\n			<td>The Election Commission published the final list of the candidates and allotted the election symbols to them.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>October 12</td>\r\n			<td>Prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba fired four ministers from the Janata Samajwadi Party from the cabinet.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>October 13</td>\r\n			<td>The chief minister of Madhesh Pradesh, Lal Babu Raut, sacked three ministers of Nepali Congress.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h2>Coalition of the parties for election</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For the upcoming election, the ruling alliance had earlier formed an electoral coalition of its five-member parties – Nepali Congress (NC), CPN Maoist Center, CPN (Unified Socialist), Rashtriya Nepali Janamorcha and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). However, the Janata Samajwadi Party left the ruling alliance and joined hands with the CPN UML; and then Loktrantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) joined the NC-led ruling alliance. Janata Samajwadi Party was part of the ruling alliance but it chose to change the alliance after it didn’t get expected seats for the provincial elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as JSP decided to form an alliance with CPN UML for the election, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba dismissed four ministers of JSP from the cabinet. But as the election code of conduct was implemented, no political appointments could be made. In response to that, a day after, Lal Babu Raut, the chief minister of Province two, sacked three ministers from Nepali Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For provincial elections, from the ruling alliance, UML fielded 285 candidates, Nepali Congress 179, CPN Maoist 112, CPN (Unified Socialist) 66, and LSP fielded 177 candidates – and on the opposition front, CPN UML 285 candidates and the JSP has fielded 140.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Election Commission, 36 parties have submitted 661 candidates in the closed list in Province 1, while in Madhesh Province, there are 948 candidates from 36 political parties. There are 825 candidates from 41 parties in Bagmati province and 368 candidates from 31 political parties in Gandaki province. Similarly, 657 candidates from 32 political parties in Lumbini province, 222 proportional candidates from 28 political parties in Karnali province and 376 candidates from 34 political parties in Sudurpaschim province are on the closed list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among 3226 candidates in the provincial level, 1094 candidates are independent. The number of independent candidates increased after quite a few independent candidates pulled off victories, to the surprise of many, in the local polls held last May. Also, this time around, the number of dissident candidates, even at the provincial level, has increased due to intraparty tensions induced by electoral coalitions. The electoral outcome at the provincial level, therefore, will also be determined by the dynamics of dissident and independent candidates at play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are some early indications of provincial politics gaining prominence and exerting influence even at the centre, not enough emphasis has been put to institutionalise federalism – and this is reflective in the electoral dynamics of the forthcoming polls. The parties – although have adapted to the federal system, and have changed their internal administrating mechanism accordingly – the central leaders are the ones who take all the major decisions of the politics at province; particularly in the formation of coalition, in deciding the framework of seat-sharing amongst coalition partners and in the selection of candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Federalism in Election Manifestos</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In October, almost all political parties published their manifestos for the election. Of all, major priority has been given to infrastructural development and economy – like in the past. In these formative years of the federal practice, it is imperative that the political parties give equal emphasis to issues concerning institutionalisation of federalism, its effective practice and measures to solve issues attached to federalism – however, that was not to be. Despite this, manifestos have promised to strengthen federal practice – Nepali Congress has vowed to strengthen Interprovincial Council to effectively institutionalise federalism and ensure a cordial relationship between federal, provincial and local government. Likewise, other parties have also put forth some measures to better the federal practice. Some conservative parties of the likes of Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RaPraPa) have asked to scrap the federal system altogether but those fringe parties have minimal foothold in the nation – and therefore, the demand to scrap federal practice isn’t bound to get any momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Inclusion in Candidates’ Selection</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the major aims of federalism is to ensure the inclusivity of historically marginalised groups in state institutions. Now that the country has been practising federalism for about seven years, there are some early indications that federalism has been effective at increasing inclusivity of those groups. For instance, compared to the federal level, percentage representation of Janajati candidates is considerably high at the provincial level. However, much work is yet to be done to ensure better inclusivity of all historically marginalised groups. Up until today, nearly half of the minority communities have had no representation at all in the federal parliament. According to the Election Commission, only 8.54% of the total FPTP candidates for provincial elections are females – and while the CPN UML has fielded 4 Dalit candidates, CPN Maoist has also fielded only 5 candidates for FPTP polls in the provincial level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in the case of Proportional Representation nomination at the provincial level, political parties have selected those leaders who have been in the forefront of political leadership. The constitutional provision to ensure inclusivity of all has been used by political parties with the ulterior motive of serving their own interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A brief overview of last five years of Provincial Governments</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last five years, two federal governments were formed and there were quite a few changes in provincial governments at each province – Madhesh Pradesh being the sole exception. And in all those changes in provincial government, politics and political calculations at the center – that is Kathmandu – had played a determining role. This alone is enough of evidence that the practice of Nepal has been perfunctory and political parties are yet to abide by the spirit of federalism. Despite having clear constitutional provisions about rights and responsibilities of the three tiers of government – federal, provincial and local – the provincial and local governments are yet to fully exercise their authority. The erstwhile KP Sharma Oli’s government had undermined provincial and local units – and it appears as if the Deuba-led government is following the footsteps of its predecessor. The interprovincial council which was established to manage the relationship and to facilitate coordination between federal, provincial and local level. But the Deuba led government hasn’t held a single meeting of the Interprovincial council in a year, whereas KP Oli led government held only two meetings in almost three years. Madhesh Pradesh filed several cases against the federal government for the issues concerning provincial police mobilisation, Sagarmatha Forest project and division forest officer under the province, irrigation projects among others. Bagmati Province too had given several warnings that it would file cases for issues surrounding provincial police and public transportation. These are just a few representative cases – the list is long. In nutshell, Nepal is still in a transition phase when it comes to effective and efficient practise of federalism – and the political parties should now put issues surrounding federalism at the top of their priority list.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Rasila Dhamala', '/uploads/banner_image/1670584840_Ballot-boxes.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-10', '2022-11-10', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 23:05:40', '2023-01-11 11:36:19'),

On the eve of top officials visit to Nepal, MCC sent back the replies to 11 major questions along with other supplementary questions, Nepal’s finance minister had forwarded regarding the key controversies about MCC in Nepal. The reply from the US side clarified that MCC is not the part of Indo-Pacific strategy and MCC Nepal Compact is not related to any military alliance or defense strategy in any sense. It also further stated the Compact agreement doesn’t prevail over the constitution of Nepal and Nepal has sole ownership over all the intellectual property generated during the MCC implementation. However, it was straight forward stated that the compact cannot be amended at this time. Recently, newly appointed Foreign Minister of Nepal, Narayan Khadka confirmed the government is not in line to amend the compact’s provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Politicization of MCC</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The political parties and public remain widely divided over the MCC grant and on the provision of parliamentary ratification of the agreement, which would provide it with the status of a treaty. Back in 2017, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba was prime minister when the MCC compact was signed. After 4 years, Deuba is again leading the cabinet and is under moral obligation and pressure to get it ratified from the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and CPN (US) stands against certain MCC provisions and are against passing the compact in its current form. The main opponent CPN-UML which when leading the cabinet earlier was all set to ratify the compact from parliament, now appears to oppose it. This has raised the question, whether CPN-UML chairman’s KP Oli’s changing stand while in and out of government is his patriotic stake or political propaganda. Further, the hard-liner monarchist RPP led by Kamal Thapa has a positive stance in MCC’s regard. To add, this rampant polarization on MCC has stretched not only among the party cadres but to the grassroots.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Geopolitical Debates Surrounding MCC</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who align on the side of MCC being against Nepal’s national interest and potential threat to Nepal’s sovereignty consider it as a part of Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS). With the US’s visible interest and strategic shift to the Indo-pacific region through IPS, announced last June, it leaves room to presume MCC as a strategic tool to counter China’s growing influence in Nepal through BRI. It is to be noted both the MCC and BRI agreements were signed in 2017. Though China’s official stand is neutral and is stated it is Nepal’s own decision either to accept MCC or not, China’s discontent on MCC is clearly visible on China’s side. It is also reported that the anti-MCC protests being organized in Nepal are backed up by pro-China organizations and individuals. On the other hand, India as an extended party to the MCC compact, has already green signaled the compact</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal’s Credibility at Stake</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal initiated the preliminary procedures for the MCC grant way ahead in 2011. MCC agreement was finally signed in 2017. Within this timeframe, all the major parties have led the governments and were part of MCC grant procedures, some of which now seems to be against the MCC compact. Politicizing the grant for much needed hydroelectricity infrastructure for the short-term gain, not only ruins Nepal’s relationship with the US but also conveys to the international community ‘we do not know what is good for us’. MCC vice president in her last visit clearly indicated if Nepal declines the grant, the amount will be transferred to another country. It would be a diplomatic shame to reject the grant that Nepal itself applied for the self-prioritized projects and in the scenario where the US congress has already adopted the MCC compact for Nepal. Added, this would also dilute Nepal’s credibility in the international development community. Given the economic backdrop due to the COVID crisis, the MCC grant if ratified by the parliament and as the project takes off the ground, it would inject $100 million per year into the shattered economy, which would pave to be a steppingstone in the economic recovery process. Furthermore, in the midst of Nepal’s aim to upgrade to the middle-income county (MIC) by 2030, Nepal needs to maintain positive ties with the US which is one of the biggest development partners for Nepal. It is also high time for Nepal to maintain trustworthiness among the donor community by building national consensus on the MCC compact and halting the politicization of the MCC for short term political gains.</p>', NULL, 2801, NULL, NULL, 'Arpan Gelal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670585146_ROS_KTMimage_6487327.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-10', '2021-10-09', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 23:10:46', '2022-12-09 23:10:46'),

Instead of resting as advised, he was eager to promote an optics of good health and political control. But he stumbled. While he was admitted at the hospital, the Covid-19 pandemic shifted its locus from China and Iran to the US and Europe, exposing the weaknesses and strengths of many countries, including Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although China initially fumbled, it wasted no time in tackling the virus, which was first seen in Wuhan, allowing countries around the world several weeks to prepare. While countries like South Korea and Singapore displayed an ability to control the disease, many western countries failed, allowing the outbreak of Covid-19 to turn into a pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contrast in the response of developed countries to the pandemic has once again exposed the critical linkages between capitalism, democracy and politics. It has also re-emphasised what is common knowledge—that the state matters. The characteristic features of a state matter even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US is one of the most developed countries in the world and has the largest economy, but it has so far failed to put people first. Its response has been shackled by the needs of the capitalist economy and the interests of political leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case of US shows that prosperity, and capitalism, can be unwieldy and may not always serve its people when a crisis hits. Besides, growing inequality and the rise of big capitalist enterprises have pushed out a large number of people from accessing essential services and social protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the contrary, China’s image after the coronavirus scare has been mixed. While its initial response was secretive and was criticised for limiting people’s freedom, its ability to tackle the pandemic and serve people has earned praise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a helpless Nepal, China’s capacity and a friendly neighbourhood policy offer hope, which in turn can permanently alter public perceptions about the US and China, two of the world’s superpowers. The US, in particular, is gradually losing its image as a model of democracy and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a shift in public perception can have significant impacts on Nepal’s political course. While the US has been providing sustained assistance to Nepal, especially in the health sector, such support has not been visible on a national scale. Now its fall from grace, amidst a great tragedy, could harm its international standing as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandemic could generate a regional response, particularly at the initiation of India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. Such regional cooperation is based on the perception of immediate needs and interdependence of the countries in South Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Covid-19 tests the ability of globalism and international cooperation. What’s more, they also highlight the trends of anti-globalism and the role of states in managing capitalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the reasons for the tension between nationalism and globalism in the US is the gradual shift in the locus of the base of production from the US to other places in the world. As capitalism’s movement across the globe generates insecurities among people, they turn to the state for protection and, sometimes, adopt narrow ideals of nationalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such trends are already appearing in Nepal. For example, some parties and people are placing themselves on the wrong side of history by trying to cling to constructed identities like a unitary Hindu state. While a secular and federal state is inclusionary—the idea of a unitary Hindu state fails to include all communities and identities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capitalism, the rise of technology, and pandemics like Covid-19 will test the ability of Nepal to represent the interests of the people vis-a-vis capitalist or vested interests. The pandemic and its impact on the global economy is likely to be felt in Nepal, especially as it will affect remittance, tourism, foreign investments, and availability of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although major political parties have championed the idea of democratic socialism, the state is consistently unable to represent the interests of citizens. We have a fascination for big and visible infrastructure development like the railway link between Kathmandu and Tibet. The government finds ideas of big banks and commercial ventures exciting but has fixed minimum threshold for FDI at nearly half-million US dollar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal needs to think small if it is to be sustainable. To create a sustainable economy, it should promote small and medium enterprises that are based on productivity. This is primarily because the rule of law processes are largely absent in big commercial sectors like trading, where profit is largely derived from extractive practices and corruption. These sectors weaken Nepal’s economic security and fail to generate employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this idea of promoting small and medium enterprises is directly linked to the ability of the state to adopt new technologies (e.g., ridesharing, Facebook and technological integration) that will weaken the power of the state to control the power of the citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In such a situation, as PM Oli tries to go back to work and maintain political control over the political and social process that is increasingly going out of control, Nepal will have to debate and talk about our ideas about the nation-state. Do we want the state to cater to capitalist interests or do we want to put the interests of the people? Do we want to be open to foreign direct investment and technology or do we want to protect the crony capitalists? Do we want to promote productivity-based growth or corruption-based profit?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are some of the questions that the pandemic and growth of technology have raised in recent days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreak</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>UPDATED as of March 15, 2019</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is Covid-19?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How contagious is Covid-19?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did the virus come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the current status of Covid-19?</p>\r\nThe World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. As of Sunday, Covid-19 had spread to 125 countries and infected more than 156,583 people with 5,947 deaths. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 84, with two deaths. Nepal has so far reported just one case where the patient recovered.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How dangerous is the disease?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I keep myself safe?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it time to panic?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. The virus has miraculously not entered Nepal yet, except for one case in January. So far, no one else has tested positive for Covid-19 and the government has imposed travel restrictions to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article was first published in The Kathmandu Post on March 16, 2020</p>\r\n\r\n<p>https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2020/03/16/covid-19-raises-questions-about-the-future-of-the-nepali-state</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Author: Ajaya Bhadra Khanal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo: Pixabay</p>', NULL, 2813, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670745055_1670584277_coronavirus-4833754_1280.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-03', NULL, NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 23:12:04', '2022-12-11 19:36:19'),

With the elections in hand, parties have already held meetings on forming alliances, as the local-level election, five ruling party are set to forge an alliance for the upcoming elections as well. The opposition party, CPN-UML, alliance with other parties with similar interest, if not, contest the election standing alone. Extensive discussion of central political parties is seen trying to form strategic coalition and alliances, whereas, less discussions are perceptible on the provincial level. The decisions are centrally made and a task force created at the centre level is to decide seat sharing at the federal and provincial level both.It still seems as though the three-tier government structure is relied on the central political parties and the essence of federal structure being decentralised is in the shadows. Observing from the local-level election many local level parties had denied the alliance from the central level and prerogative on coalition formation was provided for the parties at the local level, which was seen as an achievement for decentralisation of political parties as well. Likewise, the current government is highly criticised on the issues of failing to institutionalise federalism. This needs to be a core agenda to be addressed by the political parties, settling the debate of non-compliance of federal government to confer power to the provincial and local governments and co-ordinate and cooperate with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the upcoming election the nominated candidates’ campaign must be people centric rather than power play. The local level election has already shown dissatisfaction of people towards the mainstream parties and elected many independent candidates as mayors. This is a proof of voters’ attitude being shifted from a state of status-quo. The next challenges allies for political parties to convince people on delivering their commitments will be a struggle, since citizens have the perception of parties vouching to things they never deliver, rampant corruption and exclusive government. Manifestos of the parties should be more realistic. Much of criticism was that the published manifestos were only available closer to the election date which left the public and concerned people with very little time to scrutinise it. The upcoming election for the political parties will have fair share responsibility of bringing committed leadership in the parliament and provincial assemblies, leaving behind the old practices as people have voiced the need of change in current state of affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Security strategies initiated for the upcoming election</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The preliminary discussions on security strategies for the upcoming election has already started. On August 15, 2022, a meeting chaired by the home minister Balkrishna Khand was held regarding the security implications and the requirement for security personnel’s’ to be stationed at the polls. The meeting formed a Central joint election cell, Home Ministry election cell and Province coordination and liaison cell. Also, central command post was formed to address the issues regarding security challenges during the election. As the voting for federal house of representatives and provincial assemblies are set to be on the same day challenges to coercion, manipulation, rigging on the votes, and irregularities are main concerns of the election security management committee. To maintain peaceful, fair and transparent election big numbers of security personnel are required to be appointed for each voting booths and more on highly security sensitive areas. According to the Nepal police, temporary police are to be hired by the end of October. For the federal and provincial level election Nepal Police has announced for 10 thousand more security personnel than the local level election and nearly Nrs. 8 billion has been provided to Nepal police for election security purposes. It is essential that fair amount of time is provided to recruit, manage and train the security personnel for the upcoming election. To maintain a democratic, transparent and fair voting atmosphere at the polling station reliable and strategic security arrangement is mandated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue for voting rights of the security personnel on duty during the election was also raised at the supreme court through filing of a writ. The apex court, single bench of Justice Bishwamber Shrestha has provided with a verdict to enroll security personnel and staffs stationed at the polls, prisoners and detainees to be listed in the temporary voters list as to ensure freedom of expression and adult franchise.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Asmita Dudhraj', '/uploads/banner_image/1670585506_Election-Commission-Nepal-EC.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-08', '2022-10-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 23:16:10', '2022-12-09 23:16:46'),

It was seen as a massive achievement for the people, establishing a decentralized structure. But the opposition to federalism from a group of people has arisen yet again appealing that federalism should be reviewed with many forefront leaders also lobbying for its dismissal. Arguments against federalism are that it has a “still centralized structure’, “was adopted only due to foreign pressure’, ‘a weak structure’, ‘redundant provincial government’, ‘federal government working against the fundamental principles of federalism’ have been at the centre of the argument. According to former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who fought for a federal structure of the government, “the issue of federalism dismissal is an effort from the people who are keen on re-establishing monarchy and will only lead to autocratic state”. Whereas, many from the opposition party – UML – have argued that it should be completely dismissed as Nepal cannot take the “burden of federalism”. Dissatisfaction of the provincial government and local government on power sharing and law formulation has once again raised questions on the prevalence of centralized mindset in the federal structure of government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any governmental structure is a medium to facilitate the people and provide them with required services, economic development and overall prosperity of the country. Citizens of the country have to discern whether the changes have helped achieve development in the country and guaranteed good governance in the government. It has been argued that 5 years of institutionalization of federalism has brought about slow progress in the country. Therefore, it is a reasonable stand to have federalism talks on the table and discuss strategies of improvement. However, a complete dismissal of the federal structure will only bring more political instability, expensive reformation, regression in 5 years of development in federalism and democracy and re-making of a constitution which may take many more years. Instead of turning Nepal into an experimental zone for various forms of government, it is essential now to identify and address the issues facing federalism – dissatisfaction of the provincial and local government, people’s concern, lack of good governance practices, decentralization of the government, improve upon exiting frameworks through conclaves, strengthening and implementing laws – retaining stability of the government, political consensus and healthy collaboration, co-ordination and co-existence of the three tiers of government to achieve progressive development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Unfulfilled Police Adjustment Process</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Police adjustment from the federal government has been in the pipeline since Nepal became a federal state. In the past, police adjustment process was stalled due to political instability caused by lack of dedicated laws, political crisis when former KP Sharma Oli attempted to dissolve the parliament and the national crisis brought on by the pandemic. As of now, all the provinces have their provincial police act in place, but are unable to implement it as police adjustment process has not been initiated by the federal government. The concern on police adjustment by the provincial governments was raised in a meeting of Ministers of all the 7 provinces in Janakpur Dham of the Madhes province. Following the agreement of 7-point declaration in the meeting, on July 8, provincial Ministers visited the capital to discuss police adjustment with the political leaders of ruling coalition.37 Even though, the meeting ended with assurance of the police adjustment would begin materializing soon, none of the province Ministers are confident in the fact that it will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schedule 6 of the Constitution of Nepal has provided for provincial police administration in managing law and order. The reluctance of federal government to go forward in police adjustment has held back provincial governments from playing a role in peace and security of the provinces and from implementing constitutional provisions, Nepal Police and Province Police Operation, Supervision and Coordination Act and provincial police act. Furthermore, the centralized mindset of the federal government not only goes against the principle of federalism but also demonstrates fear of provincial government exercising power through control over Nepal Police. Hence, all provinces have declared a protest against the federal government under the leadership of Madhes province. They have outlined the will to fight legal battles, if police adjustment is not initiated before the federal and provincial elections. The federal government needs to tread carefully, as protests amidst upcoming federal and provincial elections could cause a disruption to the process of election and jeopardize national security. Moreover, the apathetic attitude in police adjustment reflects badly on the will of federal government to institutionalize the police force according to federal structure and power and upholding the constitutional provisions.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, NULL, '/uploads/banner_image/1670585901_thumb.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-07', '2022-10-17', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-09 23:23:21', '2022-12-11 14:43:53'),

Under conditional grant, matching and special grant Rs. 240.17 billion Rs 13.57 and Rs 13.7 billion respectively have been provided to the provincial and local governments.

The budget of the provinces has mainly focused on infrastructure development, agriculture, health and social sector. Province 1 has the highest allocation of its budget to infrastructure development and health sector Rs. 13.2 billion and Rs. 3.25 billion respectively. The province has prioritised expanding its tax limits. Madhes province has given continuity to ‘Educate Daughter Campaign, and allocated a budget for farmers upliftment program, agricultural master plan, construction of agriculture roads and agriculture knowledge centre. Hence, Madhes has set its priority in the agriculture sector. Even Gandaki province has set its target on agriculture, health and tourism advancement.

The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that condemns Russia’s brutal attack in regions within Ukraine. The resolution reads that “Russia’s illegal so-called referendum within Ukraine’s internationally-recognized borders and demand it reverses its annexation declaration”. Nepal voted in favor of the UN resolution along with 143 countries which condemns Russia’s decision to annex four regions of Ukraine. Russia along with five countries voted against the resolution. However, Nepal’s immediate neighbor India, China remained absent and, quite a few African countries did the same. Nepal’s decision to vote in favor of the UN General Assembly resolution is to actively seek for promotion of international peace, security and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Power trade between Nepal and Bangladesh</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In August, Nepal and Bangladesh agreed that Nepal Electricity Authority and Bangladesh Power Development Board would send a request to the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) of India for a trilateral power trade agreement to enable the export of 40 to 50 megawatts of power generated in Nepal to Bangladesh. The statement issued by Joint Secretary Level, Joint Working Group and Secretary Level Joint Steering Committee states that two 40-50 MW could be exported from Nepal through the Bheramara High Voltage Direct Current, a transmission line system of Bangladesh. The initiatives taken from Nepal and Bangladesh to reach tripartite agreement with India for using its land for setting up transmission line. In this discourse, Nepal and Bangladesh has requested for triparty meeting and officials at NEA has sent a formal request to NVVN. However, there has been no response from NVVN side. Nepal power trade is only limited to India, the untapped potential in the energy sector of Nepal remains stagnant due to its poor geographical location. If Nepal explores its option for trading power with other countries through trilateral agreement it could surplus economy of the country. In such instances, India plays an important role in allowing its territory to be used by its closest neighbor, Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepalese Politicians and Scholars participates a Chinese event on 20th Party Congress</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An event organized by Chinese delegates in Kathmandu was attended by Nepalese politicians and scholars.

Former elected representatives ended their tenure on May 19th and seats in the local constituencies remain vacant after that. Hence, vote counting in this election should have been concluded by May 19 for the local level constituencies to run the offices without the posts being unfilled. The local level election act 2017, Article 55 states that if the election is held before the tenure of the local-level representative is ended, then the newly elected representative shall assume the office the day after the expiration of the tenure period of former representatives. The election date decided by the parliament provided only 6 days for vote counting till the local-bodies posts go vacant. The major cities take the longest as the voters exceed 100,000 people, making the one-week time period to count votes insufficient. Even 2 weeks after the conclusion of the local-bodies election, few districts still were behind in finishing the vote counts. Even though election commission officials had stated that they would put in the efforts to publish results by May 19, but did not consider the fact that the vote-counting in the major cities in the 2017 local elections had taken over 2 weeks to conclude. Not only does this leave the posts vacant for a certain time period but preludes the parliament and the election commission’s dereliction of duty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">The locus of independent candidates winning the election</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>In this election, many had filed for candidacy as independent candidates across the country. The reason as to why they filed for candidacy was the reason for changes and the need to work for development as per the local need. NC has its roots established in the centre and even other political parties such as CPN-UML, the Maoist centre have a major influence in the city. Even in such circumstances, the winning probability of an independent candidate is observed to be high. Currently, Balen shah, elected for the mayoral position in Kathmandu, won over the support of many voters in the district. Similarly, independent candidates have won in Jankapur, Dhangadi and Dharan. Even though the ruling parties have a stronger mass base, the reason behind independent candidates winning reflects people’s distrust of the mainstream parties. The parties fail to fulfil the commitments they pledge during the election. Hence, this message is then reflected in people’s voting for independent candidates. Yet, the elected independent candidates cannot work without collaborating with the mainstream parties. To fulfil the agendas of the people mainstream parties and the independent candidate must work in harmony to make the next 5 years fruitful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Ignorance of public issues and lack of public engagement</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The political culture of Nepal is more or less based on power, money, nepotism and hooliganism. Promoting successors even in politics is a trend that has been practised in Nepal from earlier years. Similarly, in a speech given by our former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said to vote for the CPN-Maoist, or else a crisis might befall the country. Such a statement has made the people and party members question his intentions. It only seems that he is campaigning for his daughter Renu Dahal, standing as a candidate in Bharatpur district, with the support of Prime Minister Deuba who sought votes for her as well. Nepotism is favoured ahead of democracy. The work towards a democratic approach is compromised, where the politics is limited to their descent. Likewise, NC leader Arzu Deuba has given a controversial statement stating the budget would not be released to the local governments where NC representatives are not elected. The autocratic tendencies of the leaders of the country have had people questioning the true motives of the people in power. Abuse of power, authority and resources from the taxpayers raises the issue of a fair and democratic process of the local election. Moreso, the outcome is self-centred politics and the real grass-root level issues such as corruption in the local government, poverty, people’s need and social and infrastructural development are side-lined. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cases of corruption in the local government are rampant as the no. cases filed throughout the previous years are numerous. According to the annual report of 2020/21 of CIAA, the cases related to local and federal government consist of 32%. This was the due season the political parties could have highlighted their main agenda but the focus is mostly seen in campaigning themselves for the election. Political parties rushed their party’s manifesto near to the election date, which held back the public scrutiny it required. Besides, the majority of the parties published their manifestos centrally, which is to assume all the local-level issues and needs be dealt in the same manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Budget announcement for the Fiscal Year 22/23</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>On May 29th, Finance Minister Janardhan presented the budget for the fiscal year 79/80. The budget size for the fiscal year consists of Rs. 1793.83 billion; 24% of the budget, accounting for Nrs. 429 billion, has been allocated to the sub-national governments. The government expenditure not only impacts the economy of the federal government but also provinces and local governments’ establishment and development. Some of the sectors the federal government has allocated to the provincial and local governments are agriculture (Nrs 10 billion for the local and provincial governments to conduct agricultural projects), health (Rs. 6.36 billion and Rs. 27 billion for provincial and local governments respectively to the health department), and education (Rs. 5.32 billion and Rs. 121.01 billion for the provincial and local level). Of the Rs 25.03 billion allocated to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration Rs. 6.35 billion and Rs. 5.6 billion have been assigned to provincial and local governments respectively. Many have criticised the budget to be rather bloated and made with the sight in mind of the future elections of the federal and provincial governments. In the previous years, the provincial governments have shown dissatisfaction with the allocation of budget,where the federal government lacks consideration towards provincial and local governments’ factual issues and needs. Even Gandaki province conducted their pre-budget discussion with the experts. The two-day discussion consisted of strengthening federalism, economic growth, creating employment opportunities, and import substitution. Similarly, a meeting on budget at the provincial assembly of Karnali province had been arranged for May 30 and 31.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Asmita Dudhraj', '/uploads/banner_image/1670733883_federalism.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-05', '2022-07-07', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 16:29:43', '2022-12-12 00:46:33'),

The meeting entailed discussion on energy, health, culture, boundary, trade issues and people to people relations. Two important high-level visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit to Lumbini and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s visit to India was also reviewed and progress of the two crucial visit was also discussion. Both counterparts expressed their satisfaction towards progress made in different areas including power sector, construction of transmission line, railway connectivity, construction of ICPs, motorable bridge and other important infrastructures. In addition to this, they also discussed early conclusion of the Transit Treaty including its Protocol and the Memorandum to the Protocol and expediting the review of the Treaty Trade. The Nepali delegates raised supply of fertilizer, waiver of restriction on export of food items. Followed by this, Nepalese delegates requested the Indian official to convene the meeting on boundary works that India is reluctant to begin the fieldwork as directed by the BWG. In the hindsight, both sides welcomed the recent signing of the MoUs between NHPC, India and IBN, Nepal on the development of West Seti and SR-6 projects. The yearly secretary level meeting helps to further strengthen the bi-lateral relation and transparently discuss on each other’s dissatisfaction or satisfaction towards the work in progress.

The meeting held discussion on border security and reducing crimes in border areas in both sides. In order to counter crimes in the border areas, effective information exchange mechanism from both the agencies could benefit to reduce through help desk and effectively monitoring the activities to avoid any difficult situations. Cross border and homogenous society cause major problem in the internal and external security of the both countries. SSB and AFP force are placed in the border to ensure peace and security and, illicit smuggling, crimes and trade. Security forces face extreme challenges due to lack of intelligence. High level communication mechanisms, building capacity of the security forces is essential and, Nepal and India have come together to deter crimes and bring forth adequate policies to deal with border issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal- China</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 12, 2022 Chinese leader Li Zhanshu paid a visit to Nepal at the invitation by Agni Sapkota. The Chinese leader is considered to be one of the closest allies to the Chinese president and also the third ranked leader in China. The Chinese leader paid courtesy visit to PM Sher Bahadur Deuba and, on the next day visit to the President Bidya Devi Bhandari was completed. Followed by the courtesy calls, Mr. Zhanshu visited heritage sites in Bhaktapur. According the gazette information, Sapkota and Zhanshu will sign a bilateral agreement on cooperation between two countries on the parliament-level. In the past few months, frequent number of visits by top Chinese leaders to Nepal reflects the Chinese agitation towards US due to their growing influence in Nepal. It can be observed that, China is being very apprehensive about the US strategy in Nepal. The Chinese leaders visit is also speculated to understand the situation of the coalition of the communist party and possibilities of unification for the upcoming election. However, communist parties are adamant of not being reunified. The Chinese leader before departing from Nepal discussed on bi-lateral issues, both the countries will work to reap common benefits through mutual affiliates which also includes BRI. During the meeting with Ministry of Foreign Affair, the both the countries agreed to further strengthen inter-parliamentary exchanges and cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal traders’ relief as Tatopani border gives custom passes On September 12, 2022, Nepali traders is in a relief as Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi border reopens. The traders have been waiting for past few months to get passes to allow containers that carried good which was targeted for Dashain Tihar festival. Until now only three containers have been passed through Tatopani border while others, are in line to get the pass to cross the border. Similarly, from Rasuwagadhi seven cargo containers have already passed and other seven still needs approval Due to the imposed restriction, report says that, some of the food items are inedible for being stranded in the border point for a longer period. The Chinese COVID instruction that restricts border movement have been difficult for the traders in terms of exporting goods. The Nepali government is trying to negotiate with the Chinese government for approval. The traders are facing huge loss as it hindered their business activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Bhandari attending the controversial meeting of Global Security Initiative (GSI) On September 23, 2022, The President of Nepal Bidya Devi Bhandari participated virtually on the GSI meeting despite restriction from the PM and the Foreign Minister. The event was organized by the Chinese communist party. The redundant pressure from the Chinese government was given to Nepal government to support the security initiative by President Xi Jingping. However, the government of Nepal did not join the initiative citing NAM policy. Despite advising the president of being a part of the controversial event that might challenge Nepal Foreign Policy and Nepal’s necessity to be abided to NAM policy, President Bhandari took part in the conference and her statement was aired in the conference. The president’s officials claimed that her participation and delivering speech in the event was well informed to the PM. Several foreign diplomats raised their concern on her participation as being immature attempt. Aftermath of the event, it immediately drew attention among the diplomats, academia and journalist. Concerns were raised on government institutions’ lack of understanding on foreign policy and president’s impractical gesture for strictly not enduring to the Nepal’s foreign policy. Such participates impedes the foreign engagements of Nepal when government institutions function independently. In the regional politics president’s participation will result in chances of ruining the bi-lateral ties. It is anticipated that such gesture will be likely be misused by the other stakeholders. However, the participation will also hamper the internal/domestic politics of Nepal as it portrays weak governance and questions proficiency of the government in dealing foreign relations.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Prakriti Adhikary', '/uploads/banner_image/1670733936_Li-Zhanshu.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-09', '2022-11-03', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 16:30:36', '2022-12-11 16:32:15'),

Likewise, it is also an opportunity to further deepen ties for the current government which has friendly diplomatic relation with India and Bangladesh in comparison to the previous Oli administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal-China</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal dragged into Taiwan Controversy</span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan was mired in controversy despite of knowing that China-US relation was in a sensitive stage. The Chinese decry her visit and stated that it was a serious violation of one-China policy. Chinese government’s invasion to Taiwan has been heated debate over the decades among international politics forming various opinion and showing concerns to the Taiwanese. After the visit of Pelosi, the Ambassador Hou on Pelosi’s visit released a statement firmly opposing her visit to Taiwan. Besides this, Nepal government was also dragged unnecessarily in this matter quoting “China appreciates Nepal’s commitment to one-China principle and resolute opposition to Taiwan Independence”. 38 Chinese have been practicing assertive in Nepal’s foreign policy, this is a prime example of how Chinese are dragging Nepal into its internal matter. The statement by the Chinese Ambassador was condemned by the public personnel, intellectuals and academia’s, journos.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Foreign Minister Narayan Khadka visited China</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hon. Dr Narayan Khadka paid three days visit to China to hold a bilateral talk with the State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China H. E. Mr Wang Yi leading their respective delegations in Qingdao, China. This marked the first high-profile visit from Nepal to China ever since the formation of the Deuba government in July 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While in the past few years, China’s main strategy in extending its influence over Nepal has been to court the Nepali communist parties and keep those parties under its influence, lately, China has also tried mending its relationship with the Nepali Congress. China’s new approach was evident during Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to Nepal last March, and also during the visit of Liu Jianchao – head of the International Liasion Department of the Chinese Communist Party – the last month. During both these high-level visits, Nepali Congress’s leaders were also prioritized, albeit not in equal measure to that of the communist ones. After the split of the Nepal Communist Party – which was formed with the merger of the CPN UML and the CPN Maoist Center – China has perceived that its influence over Nepal is gradually dwindling. For China, the parliamentary ratification of the US’s Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact which it had labelled as the “pandora box” was glaring evidence of its slipping influence over Nepal. Ever since then, China has realized that while pushing for the communist coalition could still be its long-term strategy in Nepal, a good relationship with the Nepali Congress is of equal importance – if not more. Through plenty of incidents it can be observed that Chinese influence immersed in domestic politics while NCP in the power as the Oli led government had voted in favor of Beijing’s new security law for Hong Kong that was introduced in the midst of Hong Kong pro-democratic protest</p>\r\n\r\n<p>– which had provisions of harsh penalties for vaguely defined political crimes– at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHCR). The decision made by the Oli led government was against the Foreign Policy of Nepal as Nepal has adopted the NAM and it is evident that China’s political clout is growing in internal politics of Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other side, Minister Khadka’s visit was right at the time of the Taiwan crisis induced by the visit of the US Congress’s Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan – a semi-autonomous self- governing island that China claims to be its integral part. Minister Khadka’s visit to Taiwan was planned much before international media even began speculating over Pelosi’s visit. Therefore, on Nepal’s part, Minister Khadka’s visits carried no symbolic meaning in regard to the Taiwan Crisis. It was even reported that there were some deliberations on the part of Nepal’s government regarding the visit at the time of the heightened geopolitical crisis between the two superpowers. However, for China, the timing of the visit was an opportune moment to emphasize and highlight Nepal’s unequivocal adherence to the One China Policy. This is also evident from the fact that Nepal was unnecessarily dragged into the Taiwan Crisis – the statement of the Chinese ambassador to Nepal about the Taiwan crisis reiterated Nepal’s commitment to the One China policy while the statement of Nepal’s Foreign Ministry had only mentioned that Nepal was maintaining a close watch of the unfolding crisis in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the visit, Minister Khadka signed quite a few agreements with his counterpart – 800 million RMB (Rs 15 billion) grant assistance to Nepal being the major one. The agreement however wasn’t mentioned at all in the statement issued by China’s foreign ministry. And similar to that of Foreign Minister Wang’s visit and CCP’s International Liasion Head Liu Jianchao’s visit, this visit also marked no further development in regard to the implementation of the BRI agreement. The BRI agreement has been in limbo ever since 2017 but China has shown little to no interest at all in carrying the agreement to the implementation phase. While the Chinese statement stated that China is willing to carry forward the BRI agreement, the Nepali statement didn’t mention anything at all in relation to the BRI.44 This perhaps could have to do with the facts that – i) China’s repeated assertions of implementing the BRI agreement have essentially been rhetorical ones and ii) the Deuba government has had apprehensions regarding the BRI agreement – its loan component, and other provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal airlines loss due to Chinese rusted planes</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chinese planes that arrived in 2014, have been on the grounds over two years. The Ministry of Finance have been paying the interests of the loans for the aircrafts. The Chinese planes were bought with hopes of generating revenues. The three 17-seater Y12e aircraft and two 56-seater MA60 aircraft—are parked at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu while the another one crashed in Nepalgunj and isunable to fly. The officials are still not sure for how long will the aircraft remain on the ground. The Chinese government made an agreement with Nepal aviation on November 2012 under which 7 years was grace period and payback period were until March 21, 2034. The grace period is over and Ministry of finance has started paying the interest. While the price of the unusable Chinese plane is high, the Government of Nepal should be careful and must conduct intensive inspection before buying any material from any countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Tatopani Rasuwagadhi border closed</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>China once again closed Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi border as the COVID cases spikes. Rasuwagadhi border was closed a week before Tatopani, the Custom Administrator said that no prior notice was given by the Chinese regarding shutting the border. The pandemic implication and closed border have severely impacted the traders, there has been zero human to human contact due to COVID and the trucks that were to deploy for Nepal has been stranded as the borders are completely shut down for trade. Due to this, businesses have faced turmoil as currently the festive season is lined up and there are no goods to sell in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Discussion on Transitional Justice with Oli</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The UN’s Resident Coordinator in Nepal, Richard Howard along with the ambassadors of the United States of America, The European Union, the European Union, Germany, Australia and Switzerland held meeting with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Oli. The concerns expressed by those diplomats surrounded the exemption of perpetrators on serious violations of human rights in the proposed amendment to the Transitional Justice Act. The transitional justice process has been on limbo since 2015. Then the supreme court had ruled that the law fails to meet Nepal’s legal obligation internationally and domestically on various grounds which includes the two transitional justice commissions to reprieve perpetrators of serious violations of international law. The new bill eliminates previously drafted amnesty provisions, but it would still be hard to prosecute the perpetrators that were responsible for serious violations of international law, those of; people’s war crime, crime against humanity.[1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in response to the concerns of the respective diplomats, aide to Prime Minister Deuba asserted that diplomats were of the opinion that; if the victim is unsatisfied with the prosecution process by the Special court, the victim must be allowed to appeal the Supreme court. The transitional justice process should not be neglected by the parliament and the process has been prolonged over the decade. Nepal began its peace process since 2006 and the justice process is long over-due. If the bill is passed by the parliament with the necessary changes, it could be commendable as it sets up the positive benchmark in the public and international platform. The issue of transitional justice has faded away from limelight over the years – now that the elections are underway, this could be the right time on the part of the victims and the diplomats in pushing the government to pass the bill through the parliament.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Prakriti Adhikary', '/uploads/banner_image/1670734391_Border.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-08', '2022-10-20', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 16:38:11', '2022-12-11 16:40:06'),

They raised placards with slogans –“UNHCR Don’t cheat Geneva UN and Urban Refugees“, “Nepal is not the Solution for Urban Refugees“, “Resettle us somewhere to live like human beings” and “We want resettlement” – which reveals the predicaments of refugees in Nepal – and is reflective of exacerbation of refugee crisis over the years.It was specifically emphasised that “no cards, no identity”, in reference to refugee cards, has becomea major issue in exercising basic rights such as employment, health services, banking facilities, movement etc. After 2016, UNHCR cut off monthly monetary support and resettlement program ended leaving the asylum seeker helpless. An eleven-point demand was set forth by the urban refugee communities to be presented in the UNHCR and UN offices to make their lives easier in Nepal. The demonstrations are the sheer representation of refugees in crisis, due to the ignorance nonchalant attitude of Government of Nepal towards the refugee community in regards to their recognition and protection of their basic rights. and therefore, they are nowseeking help through UN agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s statistics for refugees is around 20,000, coming from Tibet, Bhutan, Myanmar, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon and other countries. These all are/were conflict-driven countries where people fled to seek refuge in various countries and some landed in Nepal as well. Whereas, ‘urban refugee’, a classification provided by the UN, stands at around 700 at present. Since the Tibetan uprising in 1959, Nepal has had an influx of refugees in the country. Since then, Bhutanese, Rohingya, Afghan, Lebanese, Syrian, and Bengali refugees have sought asylum in the country. Nepal is quite liberal with refugees from other countries, but the case is different when it comes to Tibetan refugees – and this has to do with the pressure from Beijing regarding the same. Nepal adheres to the ‘One China Policy’ hence assuring Beijing that no anti-China activity are carried outin the country. Tibetan refugees stopped receiving refugee cards in 1995. Tibetan refugees are restricted to hold demonstrations and protests, and if done so will face consequences such as being held as detainees and risk of deportation to China. Nevertheless, the challenges most refugees face (food insecurity, health care, socio-economic problem, lack of education, shelter problem) raises a series of questions toward the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2021, National Assembly held a meeting, announcing that Government is set to approve Bhutanese refugees with refugee cards which would enable them to get PAN card, to establish small businesses in the country and pursue higher education. There was no mention of Tibetan refugees for the same. Even so, the official approval of the agenda has not been concluded to date. According to some officials who talked to The Kathmandu post mentioned, “if refugee cards are provided to Bhutanese refugees who are not registered yet and children of those who have been here since 1990, there will be pressure on the government to issue similar cards to the Tibetan refugees and their children.” The realisation of the geopolitical sensitivity the issue carries has held back government to take any further action on the matter and depicts discriminatory policies. In the case of Urban refugees, Government of Nepal has never provided any public declaration on providing facilities or resettlement plans, yet, the cabinet provides decisions as partial measures upon request of the UNHCR – waiving penalty fees for overstaying their visa-period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal has not ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 protocol, hence, categorises refugees as ‘illegal immigrants.’ However, this does not give the country permission to devalue lives of the refugees as Nepal has ratified UDHR, ICCPR, ICSECR, CAT and many other conventions to protect human lives and their dignity. The dire situation of Bhutanese, Rohingya, Tibetan refugee, and other refugees in Nepal has portrayed differently. Many politicians exert that the assistance it has provided to refugees is on humanitarian grounds and under pressure from western countries. Nevertheless, claims of Nepal defying customary international laws and the inability to follow through recommendations provided by the UNHCR are highlighted in the UN Periodical review. Nepal has showed instances of refoulement of Tibetans on exile, but many cases are not reported. This is a setback for Nepal on the grounds of promotion and protection of human rights principles, and increases vulnerability for the Tibetan refugees to be deported back to China when agreements such as Boundary management system and Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters are present with China. Nonetheless, Nepal even in future is not willing to ratify any of the refugee and stateless related conventions due to its geo-location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The political will to resolve the refugee problem in Nepal should be stronger. Refugees’ statelessness can have security challenges for small economy like Nepal, where no records mean no control (crimes, violation of human rights, lack of identity, hindrance in free movement, border security). It is eminent for the country to have clear legislative framework on immigration, refugee and asylum laws, policies and plans to mitigate challenges that has been brought forth by the refugee contention. Refugee from different countries face different challenges, nonetheless, fundamental framework to address granting refugee status, refugee management, resettlement plans, repatriation strategies without breaching non-refoulement principles must be in place. Whereas, if Nepal is not willing to be the host country for refugees, it should have concrete measures to facilitate them, in collaboration with the related institutions and countries, on their resettlement to safe-haven. The increasing ties between China-Nepal can be a predicament to ratifying international conventions, but Nepal needs to have plans and policies to address national security and problems of refugee before any contingencies occur from refugee influx than having to deal to with when the problems arise.</p>', NULL, 2847, NULL, NULL, 'Asmita Dudhraj', '/uploads/banner_image/1670735191_pic-ref-page0001.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-07', '2022-07-11', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 16:51:31', '2022-12-11 16:51:49'),

During his visit, he met with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba as well as communist leaders K P Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and others. China has consistently engaged with communist forces in Nepal and the latest visit comes amidst speculations over a possible reunification or an electoral alliance of the left parties of Nepal for the upcoming federal and provincial elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some claim that Liu’s visit should be seen in the context of his appointment as the CCP’s new head of the International Liaison Department making familiarization with the ground realities of Nepal-China relations. However, during his visit, Liu urged Nepali communist leaders to reunite or at least form a coalition. China, by pushing for the communist coalition, aims to reinstate its lost influence over Nepal – which had reached a new height when the erstwhile communist alliance led by the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was at the helm of the Kathmandu administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepali officials have time and again maintained that foreign forces do not have a role in Nepal’s internal affairs. However, Nepal has experienced various instances of Chinese overreach in its</p>\r\n\r\n<p>domestic affairs over the past few years – Liu’s push for a communist coalition is yet another Chinese step in extending its interference in Nepal’s internal matters. Just a few months back, China had facilitated the disinformation campaign against the parliamentary ratification of the highly politicized MCC compact of the United States. The compact’s eventual ratification, however, had served as a moral defeat for China. Now with Liu Jian Chao’s visit, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit in late March, China has demonstrated that it has enduring ambitions in Nepal – and is ready to go to length in facilitating the communist coalition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu’s visit also came at a time when yet another American program – State Partnership Program (SPP) – has triggered debates, reminiscent to the MCC compact. Moreover, along with meeting with Tibetan leaders and visiting refugee camps in Nepal, American officials have been putting pressure on the Nepali leadership for Tibetan refugee rights during their visits. Tibet remains a sensitive issue for China. Nepal’s official acknowledgement of the One-China policy and the core tenet of its foreign policy to now allow its territory to be used against other countries makes it a geopolitically sensitive issue for Nepal as well. Government officials have said that Nepal should continue to reassure its bilateral partners and especially its neighbors that all decisions related to its partners will be taken for Nepal’s own national interests and not against anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal – India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maoist chair, Pushpa Kamal Dahl visited India from July 15-17 at the invitation of the President of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), JP Nadda as a part of the “Know BJP” campaign. In what he called a “goodwill visit” to India he also met with in-charge, Department of Foreign Affairs (BJP) Vijay Chauthaiwale, Indian Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval59. While media reports said that he was also scheduled to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indian officials claimed that a visit between the two was never scheduled. Pushpa Kamal Dahal labelled the visit as a fruitful one while S Jaishankar remarked that “India will remain a steadfast partner of Nepal in its quest for progress and prosperity, reflecting its Neighborhood First Policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dahal’s relationship with India over the last few years has been tumultuous at best – and therefore, the visit was primarily guided by a motive of improving the CPN Maoist Center’s ties with the Delhi administration and the ruling party BJP. Further, the current coalition government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba is perceived to be friendly to India, unlike the previous one led by then NCP leader KP Sharma Oli. Given that the current ruling coalition also includes CPN Maoist Center, the BJP’s invitation to Dahal at the same time Beijing has been pushing for the communist coalition in Nepal hints at Delhi’s attempts to take Dahal and his party into confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal – USA</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"color:#0000FF;\">Succeeding Ambassador to Nepal reiterates commitment to pushing rights for Tibetan Refugees:</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Dean R Thompson, currently serving as the US State Department’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs is set to take up his new assignment as the United States Ambassador to Nepal, succeeding Randy Berry.

He also said that he would” push for the rights of all Nepali citizens and residents including the Dalits, marginalized communities, and refugee communities, including Tibetan refugees. In his statement, Thompson also highlighted that Nepal had ratified the MCC compact despite China’s disinformation campaign against the compact. The United States has been pushing for rights of Tibetan refugees in Nepal for decades but it has become a point of focus for American delegations visiting the country since the ratification of the MCC compact.

He had played a key role in Nepal’s eventual endorsement of the MCC compact earlier this year.

In an interesting development, Minister Narayan Khadka announced on the day of Lu’s arrival that Nepal had formally informed the United States about its decision to withdraw from the program.

The bill has been pending in parliament for two years. The main point of contention between the political parties is whether to keep the time limit in granting naturalised citizenship to foreign-born women, married to Nepali men. The proposal issued by State Management and Good Governance Committee suggested that the temporary identity card be issued immediately after solemnisation of the marriage except for political rights and naturalised citizenship which is to be granted only after seven years. However, the Congress and Janta SamajBadi Party (JSP) has dissented from this view. These parties have expressed the stand that a foreign woman who marries a Nepali man should apply for citizenship immediately without a waiting period of seven years. Furthermore, provision of getting naturalised citizenship should be included in the application of the foreign women. Even now, the Congress is in favor of moving the bill forward with the same provision. During the meeting, Dev Gurung, chief whip of the UCPN (Maoist) parliamentary party, had said that there should be a limit on acquiring citizenship on the basis of the report submitted by the committee. He was of the view that open borders with India and the issue of nationality are sensitive as they are linked with issue of citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears that there exists different points-of-view amongst the political parties regarding the bill that is designed to amend the Nepal Citizenship Act 2006. It may be argued that, in the absence of consensus between the political parties, political intervention may create more problems and differences than finding a solution. However, there were voices inside the ruling alliance that opines that bill must be passed to guarantee citizenship rights to all those eligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, political analyst, Tulanarayan Sah and Surendra Labh, are sceptical as to the discussion being initiated with the intention of passing the bill in parliament. Critics suspects that the government is using this issue for political maneuvering in the run-up to the local level election schedule to be held in the month of May 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 20 September, 2021, the House of Representative (HoR) endorsed the national budget amidst constant obstruction from the lawmakers in the opposition.

According to the national guard website, SPP is a “partner focused, strategically aligned” program administered by the National Guard Bureau of the United States that conducts military-to-military engagements in support of defence security goals becoming a key U.S. security cooperation tool, facilitating cooperation across all aspects of international civil-military affairs and encouraging people-to-people ties at the state level”. “The program has a focus on disaster response, aviation safety and operations, leadership development, military medical fields, and cyber defence, etc.” The visit of the Commanding General of the US Army Pacific Charles Flynn caused a commotion in the country when he encouraged Nepal to become a part of the program in his meetings with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Nepal Army chief General Prabhu Ram Sharma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arguments around the SPP are reminiscent of the MCC compact; with people questioning whether Nepal joining the SPP would make it a part of the United States’ military alliance under the Indo-Pacific Strategy. While some have argued that agreeing to become a part of the SPP could have long term implications on Nepal’s national security and sovereignty, others argue that the program is being unnecessarily politicised when these forms of military agreements between Nepal and the United States are a continuation of bilateral engagements that have existed for decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The incoherence among statements made by parties involved has also emerged as a strategic fault on the part of Nepali leaders and institutions. In the initial stages of the debate, Minister for Home Affairs had denied that Nepal was involved in the SPP in any way. This was followed by the United States Embassy in Nepal issuing a statement clarifying that while SPP is not a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, it was not proposed to Nepal and that Nepal had actually applied for the program. The Nepal Army refuted embassy claims and issued a statement outlining that it had never entered any such agreement with the US Military. However, a leaked letter published by Kantipur revealed that Nepali Army had initiated a request to be included in the United States’ State Partnership Program in the backdrop of the disastrous earthquake of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The perennially feuding Nepali leaders used the controversy to engage in blame games and one-upmanship. While the leaders of the ruling coalition put blame on CPN-UML for agreeing to be a part of the program, UML leaders blamed Nepali Congress for making the request when it was in charge. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is also under pressure to disengage with the program from within his party, the ruling coalition, and the opposition due to a lack of consensus over SPP. The parliamentary committee launched an investigation into the matter and asked the attendance of Minister of Foreign Affairs Narayan Khadka and Chief of Army Staff (CoAS) Prabhu Ram Sharma at the House committee meeting. The CoAS was asked to give clarity on which government had approved the Nepal army to write the letter in 2015. He maintained that Nepal Army was clear of any wrongdoing as the institution has not moved anything forward without the prior consultation and approval of the Government of Nepal. as A cabinet meeting on June 21 decided not to participate in SPP, also acknowledging that correspondence involving foreign parties should be channelled through the Foreign Ministry. However, Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand created confusion when he said that the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what has become another political blunder for Nepal, the incident has exposed the duplicity of Nepali leaders’ and called into question the coordination, transparency and accountability of government institutions. In addition, the politicisation of the involvement of Nepal Army has caused damage to the institution’s otherwise stable reputation. The politicisation of SPP could cause strain in Nepal- US ties that had only just recovered after the ratification of MCC, which was a cause of great frustration for the United States. The lack of expert discussions, inter agency coordination, and broad consensus on foreign policy across parties has caused major blows to Nepal international credibility once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal – China:</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Those opposing the State Partnership Program (SPP) program within Nepal had also voiced concerns that any form of formal military agreement with the United States could invite harsh reactions from China. China had held back from making any official statements while the fate of SPP was being debated in Nepal. However, after a cabinet meeting decided not to move forward with the SPP program, when asked about China’ position on the issue, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of China, remarked that China had taken note of the controversy over the program and commended the Nepali Government’s decision. He also added that “China will continue to support Nepal in upholding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and support Nepal’s commitment to its independent and non-aligned foreign policy”.It is also worth noting that this was the first time the Spokesperson addressed Nepal since the MCC compact was ratified in the country despite Chinese displeasure. Even then, the official had remarked that the United States was practising coercive diplomacy over MCC in Nepal. China has clearly been opposing American ventures in Nepal which some have also interpreted as attempts to meddle in Nepal’s internal matters and influence decision making.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal – India:</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal has become a power surplus country with India becoming its first partner for energy export. Propelled by the onset of monsoon season and continuous rainfall, Nepal has begun exporting a total of 364 MegaWatt of surplus electricity produced by Trishuli and Devighat Hydropower Projects (37.7 MW), Kaligandaki Hydropower Project (140 MW), Middle Marsyangdi (68 MW), Marsyangdi (67), and Likhu-4 (51 MW). According to Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), Nepal has been exporting surplus electricity to India through its power exchange market for the second year in a row. Nepal also has plans to extend its cross border energy export to Bangladesh via India with an agreement already in place. The arrangement provides India with an affordable source of electricity, while generating revenue for Nepal. This is also a big step for Nepal in actualising its hydropower potential.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670735614_Nepal_USA_SPPAgreement.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-06', '2022-06-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 16:58:34', '2022-12-11 16:58:34'),

About 70 participants attended the event including politicians, bureaucrats, diplomats, former army personnel, journalists and reporters, and scholars of various fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first session on Military Diplomacy of Nepal covered various topics, the summary of which is provided below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussant panel of the first session included the former COAS of the Nepal Army General Gaurav Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, Chairperson of Janata Samajbadi Party and Former Foreign Minister Upendra Yadav, Maj.

The session was moderated by senior journalist and current affairs editor at The Annapurna Express Kamal Dev Bhattarai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The themes covered during the panel discussion have been summarized as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of the Nepal Army in Diplomacy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General Gaurav Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana began the panel discussions by highlighting that a sophisticated world view is an effective armor in the changing world order. He argued that while it seems to be absent in Nepal’s policy makers and decision makers, the Nepal Army has acknowledged the necessity to adapt. He added that from an academic perspective, military diplomacy is a recent term because initially the objective of military-to-military undertaking was to facilitate communication between two militaries and was not considered to be an extension of foreign policy. However, it has become the need of the hour.

He added that from an academic perspective, military diplomacy is a recent term because initially the objective of military-to-military undertaking was to facilitate communication between two militaries and was not considered to be an extension of foreign policy. However, it has become the need of the hour. The General argued that while military is known as a hard power tool, it can also be used as a soft power tool to achieve broader foreign policy objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The General argued that dissonance among various ministries and leaders on SPP resulted in the national frenzy and politicization of the matter and urged the need for robust mechanisms to boost coordination between relevant ministries and organizations. He also said that it is important to understand that the “Nepal Army is an instrument of the state and not the state itself. Therefore, there is no need for confusion on the form of diplomacy or what state institution’s agenda it is, as long as it is for the national interest of the country”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Civilian perspective on Military Diplomacy of Nepal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Deepak Prakash Bhatt began his statement by saying that Military Diplomacy is a very relevant topic in the discourse as the context of the world continues to change. He argued that the interface between relevant ministries and Nepal Army lack oversight and those agencies are responsible for the lack of coordination and even during policy making. He also said that Nepal lacks an active mechanism to discuss the overall security issues of the country. In agreement with the previous speaker, he said that differences among political leaders and parties over topic such as MCC and SPP is also the reason why these issues are often blown out of proportion instead of having a conducive discussion. He said that while Nepal believes in pluralism so it is natural to find differences in political belief over foreign policy and other issues, there is a lack in the very will to find consensus over these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Bhatt said that defense diplomacy should be a formal part of Nepal’s foreign policy because peace and security is an important component of Nepal’s foreign policy and military is an integral component in its pursuit. However, the system and structures are weak and the lack of timely discussions puts civilians and other institutions in confusion, eventually causing frenzy. Furthermore, Political instability, lack of consensus on broad national policies, coupled with absence of institutional memory transfer among Nepali institutions has hindered Nepal’s pursuit of national interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Objective of Nepal’s Military Diplomacy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major General Purna Bahadur Silwal began his statement by saying that military diplomacy is another resource of the state to achieve national interests of Nepal. Military is a part major means to fulfil national interests along with diplomacy, information, and economic means. He cited the example of Ukraine’s robust military diplomacy even during the time of war. He also mentioned how the Minister of defense of India is the part and parcel of Indian diplomacy which has played a vital role in bolstering India’s foreign policy achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major General Silwal said that the objective of Nepal’s military diplomacy is to modernize, build capacity, and professionalize. He said that Nepal has been engaging with foreign countries in various ways to achieve national interests and supplement broader diplomacy through the stationing of military attaches in different parts of the world, diplomatic activities such as exchange of personnel for military training and exchanging skillsets, joint military exercises, bilateral meeting including ambassadors, military aid and purchase of military hardware, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He argued that strong military to military ties between two countries can be leveraged to achieve broader foreign policy objectives. For instance, during the earthquake, military diplomacy facilitated the arrival, response activities and departure of friendly foreign countries such as India, China, and USA. Similarly, effective diplomatic intervention made by the Nepal Army played a significant role in the lifting of the economic blockade of 2015. Furthermore, Nepal’s significant contribution in peacekeeping missions in the United Nations has played a particularly notable role in enhancing Nepal’s image in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General Gaurav Shumsher Jung Bahadur said that while Military is known as a hard power tool, it can also be used as a soft power tool to achieve broader foreign policy objectives. Maj. Gen Purna Bahadur Silwal also said that strong military ties between two countries can be leveraged to achieve broader foreign policy objectives. Chairperson of Janata Samajbadi Party and Former Foreign Minister Upendra Yadav said that Nepal must abide by its non-alignment policy and reject proposals for military partnership with foreign countries. Once again highlighting the need to formally incorporate military diplomacy in Nepal’s foreign policy, Major General Silwal said that “when traditional methods retire, military diplomacy prevails”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diplomacy for the pursuit of national interests</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hon’ble Upendra Yadav said that the MCC debacle brought into light the intensification of geopolitical competition in Nepal such as the misinformation campaigns and attempts to influence Nepal’s decision making on issues pertaining to its national interest. However, Nepal must adhere to one of the core tenets of its foreign policy – to not allow its territory to be used by a foreign country and against another country and it the same vein clarify its position to all its bilateral partners that it refuses to establish any form of formal security, strategic partnership with a foreign country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also said that it is normal for deepening military ties with a foreign country to sound off alarms. However, military relations and diplomacy should be promoted and partnerships should be continued through due process. He highlighted that the government has and should continue to reassure its bilateral partners and especially its neighbors that all decisions related to its partners will be taken for Nepal’s own national interests and not against anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a part of the ruling coalition government, Hon’ble Upendra Yadav said that Nepali political parties differ in their view of international relations and foreign policy and have thus often been unsuccessful in forging consensus on matters of foreign policy, security, and economic development. He also argued that our national security policy has not come into the public discourse either. He said that what Nepal is currently seeing the ramifications of the lack of consensus, institutional difference, lack of understanding, and half take statements on matters such as MCC and SPP.</p>', NULL, 2860, NULL, NULL, NULL, '/uploads/banner_image/1670736115_IMG-20220722-WA0014-1-1920x1436.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-08', '2022-08-08', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:06:55', '2022-12-11 17:06:55'),

Therefore, it is imperative to consider the opinion of general public to take people into confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities issued a statement alleging the census enumerators did not ask the questions on language and religion and themselves filled in the answers to the questions. An incident took place in Lamjung, where an enumerator was apprehended because he/she listed their religion as Hindu despite being told that they are Buddhists. Similarly, in Saptari, Siraha and Dhanusha, local enumerators were accused of writing without asking questions when compiling data on language and religion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizens also showed discontentment towards the set of questionnaires. According to Sarita KC, executive director of Mitini Nepal, an LGBTI organisation; the main census questionnaire did not recognised queer people and categorized the head of the household only as man or woman, not listing themselves based on their gender identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions were raised on the method of counting caste-ethnicity (jaat-jaati) by the enumerators, where they allegedly presumed the caste and ethnicity of their respondents. According to the enumerator’s handbook, jaat relates to a hindu caste surname, whereas jaati refers to indigenous ethnicity. However, because the same question seeks to address both jaat and jaati, responding to it can be highly perplexing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Experience of Hardship by Enumerates</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The enumerators also raised their grievance towards the attitude of the citizens, who were reluctant to provide information. Some even denied to participant in the census and some provided wrong information.There is a need to take people into confidence and make them aware of the census. In an another instance, Dalits living in rented houses were reluctant to disclose their last name due to fear of eviction during census. Dalits usually don’t reveal their last names or they lie about being from an “upper caste”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts claimed that, the public’s reluctance to share their information could be due to a lack of education and awareness about the census’ importance and due to social stigma. Furthermore, the experts indicated that fears about Covid-19 might be one of the reasons why individuals are unwelcoming to enumerators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The enumerators also had problem conducting census in two village of Darchula- Tinkar and Chhangru. The Indian authorities refused to give entry passes to use the Indian territory to reach the villages, citing “damaged road”. The team had to used the long-abandoned foot trail to cross into the two villages. After the work, team were flown to the district headquarters Khalanga by a helicopter. Nepali Officials suspects that Indian authorities denied the entry because of fear that the enumerator might conduct an informal census in the Kalapani area, which India claims as its territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Conclusion</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Census have significant implications in Nepali politics mainly because it will determine political and bureaucratic representation of women, Madeshis, Dalits, Indigenous and marginalised community. Census is also an innovative means for developing and executing social innovations aimed at addressing social, geographical and economic issues that affect society. However, citizens have raised their doubts over the census data for under representing people from different categories like religious minorities, language, caste and ethnicity. Thus, census should be free from controversy and doubts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The preliminary result of the census would be announced after three months and the final result would be made public after a year.</p>', NULL, 2847, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1670736256_census.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12', '2021-12-08', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:09:16', '2022-12-11 17:09:54'),

Discussants for the topic included Honorable Mr. Divya Mani Rajbhandari, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the House of Representatives; Honorable Dr. Deepak Prakash Bhatt, also a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the House of Representatives at the Federal Parliament of Nepal; Dr. Achyut Wagle, noted economist and Associate Dean at the Kathmandu University School of Management; and Ms. Avasna Pandey, Lecturer at the Tribhuvan University’s Department of International Relations and Diplomacy. The panel was moderated by Ambassador Vijay Kant Karna, Executive Chair at CESIF Nepal, while Mr. Ajaya Bhadra Khanal, Research Director at CESIF Nepal, provided further insights into the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The discussion aimed to bring out deeper insights on an inadequately discussed subject of Nepal’s cross border relations with its northern neighbor, China. CESIF had recently conducted a research on the same topic, with Ms. Shraddha Ghimire leading the research – the findings of which she presented at the webinar. Her presentation brought out much of the lesser known facts about this particular border dynamics whilst providing recommendation for mutual benefit. Following Ghimire’s presentation, the commentators put forth their remarks on various issues as detailed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Event Details</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Date: 28/01/2022<br />\r\nTime: 3 PM – 5 PM<br />\r\nVenue: Zoom Meetings Number of Participants: 50 which included intellectuals, politicians, former diplomats, and journalist<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Border Management and Security</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The border at the Nepal side is guarded by a coordinated force comprising Nepal Armed Police and Nepal Army while it is jointly managed by immigration and customs offices in addition to security forces. Ms. Ghimire, on her presentation, shed light on joint mechanism of border management between security personnel from Nepal and China. She further highlighted that the difficult geographical terrains in the northern border, coupled with limited surveillance tools, lack of technology and deployment of limited security forces has impeded border management in Nepal’s side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Achyut Wagle stated that one of the key aspects of Nepal-China cross-border relations is national security. He provided insights on the Chinese narrative and suggested that the recent blockade of the transshipment of the goods, other economic activities and restrictive people’s mobility is linked to the national security. He further added that the periodic review of border management is necessary for evidence-based diplomacy as opposed to pre-emptive diplomacy which Nepal usually opts for. Furthermore, Nepal needs to be technologically equipped to manage borders and its security better.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Cross Border Mobility Issues, Trade, and Transit</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The visa regulation between Nepal and China allows civilians to cross the border up to 30 KM within Tibet and vice-versa. Smuggling of traditional and mountainous herbs, television, gold, pashmina, and red sandalwood via the border is frequent, as revealed by the research, together with human trafficking for manual labor and prostitution. However, there are restrictions on Sherpa and Lama descent to go to Tibet for religious purpose, owing to its political sensitivities. The research also divulged that the borders have been completely closed due to Covid-19 since 2020 and no joint border surveillance and other mechanisms have taken place. Only 3 – 5 trucks have been entering Nepal, daily, which has immensely impacted local traders and other businessperson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s relationship with China is based on two fronts – commerce and political balance. Ms. Avasna Pandey stated that China’s aggressiveness owing to its confrontational policy while dealing with its neighboring country has resulted in tighter security and border closures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Ajaya Bhadra Khanal while speaking about trade and transit, alluded that there has been a virtual blockade of transit point since 2015 and now there’s one way control of the same. He posed a question to the panelists as to “What happened to the discourse of Nepal’s right to access of sea-ports?” He also mentioned the need of trade promotion through import substitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Wagle emphasized on the human perspective in the cross border relations, including culture, tradition, languages, and ecological system. The ground-reality of the bordering districts fail to make way for real discourses. He stated that Nepal and China have signed numerous instruments to enhance trade, connectivity, and infrastructure; and questioned the status of these instruments. The data shows that the trade relations with China is mostly unilateral as for the last three consecutive years, the import-export ratio between China and Nepal is 1:100. While Nepal exported Nrs. 2 billion worth of goods, it imported Nrs. 200 billion worth of goods from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hon. Dr. Deepak Bhatt pointed out that trade imbalance with China should be addressed through timely diplomatic initiatives. “We have set mechanism to resolve all the issues and these mechanisms should be invoked while resolving any issues we have with China,” he added.<br />\r\nHon. Dibya Mani Rajbhandari talked about the need of Nepal government’s effort to address the problems of people residing on the bordering districts understanding their plight to curb cross-border human trafficking. Similarly, there should be a detailed study on how to address trade imbalance and to regulate flow of goods.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Chinese Foreign Aid and Development Cooperation</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The presenter mentioned China has been using foreign aid as a strategic tool to counter India’s influence in Nepal. China’s FDI is mainly concentrated in the northern districts of Nepal bordering with the Tibet autonomous region of China. China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) plans to finance 15 pilot development projects in 13 of the 15 districts that borders with Tibet. Further, China’s largest investments are directed in Rasuwa, Sankhuwasabha, Solukhumbu and Manang districts, while it has funded the construction of dry ports in six border points. The major sector of China’s investment is hydropower, brick industry, agriculture, and steel and construction sector. Moreover, local government units in northern border districts have received Nrs. 3 million from China. However, this funding remains inconsistent with Nepal’s International Development Cooperation Mobilization Policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Khanal emphasized on the huge gap between the China’s aid commitment and actual disbursement. China’s official assistance to Nepal has remained stagnant since 2015. The official engagement between Nepal and China is also in standstill since 2015 with no significant developments. On the contrary, Nepal has seen a gradual increase in Chinese FDI since last few years.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Nepal-China Border Issues and Concerns</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Ghimire stressed on the sensitive issue of land encroachment and construction of infrastructure by China within Nepal’s land. China’s encroachment has been reported in Sankhuwasabha, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Humla. The National Investigation Department has stated that 15 border pillars have been shifted in Humla. China has attempted to construct a 145 meters permanent canal in the same district. Similarly, out of 7 pillars, pillar number 60 is missing at Dolakha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Khanal questioned whether fear has become the most dominant element in Nepal-China relationship. The people inhabiting around the border feared retribution from the Chinese side after the government formed the task force to study the border issue in Humla. This narrative of local people is also reported on recent government’s investigative report on border encroachment in Humla. Furthermore, government’s reluctance to take up the border issue with Chinese counterpart raises a lot of suspicion. It is clear that Nepal government does not want to go beyond Nepal- China friendship rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Ms. Avasna Pandey pointed out it is important to understand Nepal-China relation in historic context to understand China’s current shift from conciliatory to confrontational foreign policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hon. Dr. Deepak Bhatt stated that Nepal should gather evidence to support its claim regarding encroachment in northern border and then have a dialogue with China to resolve the border issue. Similarly, Hon. Rajbhandari stated in-depth studies are required to verify the current status of borders in other border districts including Mugu and Dolpa. Likewise, Dr. Wagle also stated that mutual consultations and dialogues are the best measures to resolve border disputes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The panelists stressed on the reluctance of the Nepal government to acknowledge the border issues with China time and again. While the border disputes with India are often politicized in the public front, border issues with China are often sidelined. Here, Mr. Khanal connected his rhetoric of fear of Chinese retribution among the Nepali politicians and bureaucrats to confront border issues with Chinese authority. Meanwhile, Hon. Bhatt pointed out language barriers and cultural differences with China as a challenge to resolve many outstanding issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The webinar concluded with a general understanding that there are issues with China in multiple fronts, including border, trade and transit, border management, and cross border mobilities among others. Government needs to strengthen its bilateral mechanisms and strive to resolve these issues through evidence-based diplomacy. Further, the panelists agreed on the need of open discussions regarding the Nepal-China relation among the policymakers, bureaucrats, researchers, academicians, businessmen among others.</p>', NULL, 2860, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670736431_Nepals-Cross-Border-relations-with-China.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-03', '2022-03-10', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:12:11', '2022-12-11 17:14:15'),

He has been accused of seeking a ministerial berth for his brother-in-law, who was appointed as a minister on October 8. The controversy started when Gajendra Hamal, Chief Justice Rana’s brother-in-law, was appointed as one of the 18 new inductions for the Ministry of Industries, Commerce, and Civil Supplies. Since Hamal was not a member of the parliament, it was assumed that his entrance was a part of a deal between PM Deuba and Chief Justice Rana. When questions were raised over his appointment, PM Deuba requested Hamal to resign the position. Hamal’s appointment and resignation have put Chief Justice Rana and PM Deuba into the spotlight for disturbing the separation of power. In addition to that, the independence of the judiciary is also compromised when the chief of the judiciary seeks a stake in the executive body, while the political parties agree to give it to him. The cornerstone of a functional democracy is an independent judiciary, which guarantees that the branches of government operate within a system of checks and balances. However, this controversy has dismantled the separation of power questioning the independent judiciary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inclined to redeem the dignity and credibility of the judiciary, Supreme Court justices, former justices and lawyers—from Nepal Bar Association and Supreme Court Bar Association have asked Chief Justice Rana for his resignation. Chief Justice Rana has rejected the allegation against him and has refused to resign. However, he is ready to go through an “impeachment motion” in the parliament, the only way provided in the Constitution to remove the Chief Justice. Chief Justice Rana’s position has raised the threat of judicial deadlock. The faction of lawyers has decided to boycott the Supreme Court affecting the court proceedings, while justices are busy holding meetings, which in turn has affected the hearing. The ongoing protest in the Supreme Court has affected the writ of habeas corpus which has violated the fundamental right of the people in detention. It is unethical for the justices to halt justice delivery. Understanding the sensitivity of the issues, Justice Manoj Kumar Sharma told that, Chief Justice Rana has offered to hold talks with the justices to resolve the dispute and hinted that he is ready for a “graceful exit”. However, the lawyers and justices are suspicious that this could be a trick of Chief Justice Rana to drag the issue of his resignation by generating additional time period to cool down the ongoing tension in the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Political Intervention and Impeachment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the gravity of the situation, the political parties on both the ruling and opposition sides have so far been silent on the issue except for the former Prime Minister of Nepal, KP Sharma Oli. According to him, all five justices on the constitutional court including Chief Justice Rana, that overturned his order to dismiss the House of Representatives, were “politically motivated” and “must resign.” Political analysts are of the opinion that his statement has to do with his own personal interest considering the fact that he only questioned the five justices who pronounced judgment against him. Similarly, when questions were raised as to why the political parties are reluctant to speak about the ongoing judiciary crisis, political analysts and experts are of the opinion that, political parties appoint his/her party workers, without merit, in the institution created by constitutional bodies. Thus, to protect the party workers and to avoid added controversy, the best possible strategy is to be silent about the situation. The on-going controversy in the judiciary is an outcome of political meddling and flawed appointment processes. Such unethical practice is prevalent from the time of Panchayat. Therefore, the controversy has brought to light the practice of ‘bench buying’ in the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judiciary is one of the biggest and powerful instruments of democracy and the nation is extremely disappointed to see the idleness of political parties even when the judiciary is on the verge of being collapsed. But the major question is, whether the political intervention to this judicial crisis will bring out a possible solution or deteriorate the situation, considering the fact that executive body is responsible for this judicial fiasco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impeachment is the only possible intervention to this judicial crisis, as parliament is the only legitimate institution that can defenestrate the chief justice. But the prospect of parties to intervene in this matter is very unlikely as the government has prorogued the House and the political parties are divided on whether to impeach him or not. For instance, Justices, Nepal Bar Association, Supreme Court Bar Association, former chief justices and networks of judges want Chief Justice Rana to quit. Supporting this call are leaders from the ruling alliance—Nepali Congress, CPN (Maoist Center), CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajbadi Party and Rastriya Janamorcha. Some political leaders say that it is up to the judiciary to make the call. Meanwhile, Nepal’s ruling party, the Nepali Congress, remains wary of interfering with the Supreme Court’s affairs as they do not have any rights to intervene in the judiciary. Nepali Congress Joint General Secretary, Prakash Sharan Mahat, said that “nature of the current dispute in the judiciary is such that the solution should be sought by the judiciary itself, not by the political leadership.” In the absence of consensus between the political parties, political intervention may add up more problems and differences than finding a solution. However, there are voices inside the ruling alliance pressing for a solution to the problem if the judiciary is unable to do so. Madhav Kumar Nepal, a senior ruling alliance leader and chairman of the CPN (Unified Socialist), ruled out the possibility of impeaching the chief justice Rana. The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), which are in power, do not appear to be interested in impeaching Chief Justice Rana. The CPN (Unified Socialist Party) and the Janata Samajbadi Party, two other coalition partners, are too tiny. Technically, the Congress and the Maoist Centre don’t have enough votes to bring an impeachment resolution. The major opposition CPN-UML is the only party with enough Member of the Parliaments to file an impeachment resolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for an impeachment motion to be registered in the parliament, it must be signed by at least one-fourth of the total number of legislators. As soon as the motion is submitted, the chief justice is automatically suspended. The move to impeach the chief justice, however, must be approved by a two-thirds majority. Due to the composition of the House, a resolution cannot be enacted by a two-thirds majority unless all parties vote in favor. It is true that political parties should find the way out of the judicial crisis, however, lack of consensus among the political party at the current crisis may prolong the judicial deadlock. Nevertheless, the question remains, if the ruling coalition wants the impeachment and if so, will this impeachment be the remedy for all ills afflicting the country’s Supreme Court?</p>', NULL, 2847, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1670736686_Cholendra.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-11-01', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:16:26', '2022-12-11 17:16:26');

Senior Journalist and Analyst, Chandrakishore and Hon’ble Malamati Rana, Member of the Parliament of the Sudhurpaschim Provincial Parliament. The discussion was moderated by Lumana Upreti, Research Fellow at CESIF Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The webinar mainly focused on the issue of Nepal-India Cross Border Relations and challenges that exist in the smooth functioning of border relations and regional connectivity. The webinar also highlighted the economic and social hardship faced by the border inhabitants due to the political differences between two countries and lack of border policies and regulations to regulate the movement of people. There exists a policy vacuum which gives arbitrary power to the police officials stationed at the border to mistreat the border inhabitants. The speakers emphasized the need for politics of trust, understanding and dialogue between both the nations to move forward. In addition to that, the speakers maintained that economic development is a long term solution to reduce migration and vulnerabilities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Details</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h4>Ajaya Bhadra Khanal</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The first speaker Ajay Bhadra Khanal provided brief analysis findings of the Nepal- India Cross Border Relation research, conducted by CESIF. He began by providing a brief disclosure on the findings of the research. The research revealed two important findings. First, Anti-Indian nationalism is prevalent in Nepal. Consequently, India is seen as a threat to Nepali nationalism. Second, despite these sentiments, millions of Nepali youth migrate to India for job opportunities and to sustain their livelihood. Till this date, millions of Nepali people’s livelihood, social security and kinship relationship is interlinked with India. There appears a contradiction: the struggle between sustaining a livelihood and the sentiments of anti-India nationalisms. The speaker argues that addressing these two issues together is very important at this juncture to improve Nepal-India border relations and regional connectivity. Nevertheless, down the road is not so easy as there exists multiple challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speaker then addressed the challenges. First challenge is the issue of National security. Cross border migration is characterized as dangerous mobility by Nepal’s top level decision makers. Bureaucrats and policy makers see migration through an open border as a serious threat to National Security-infringing the sovereignty and territorial integrity. Secondly, political relations between both the countries have time and again affected the status of border and border related conflicts. For an instant- blockades. Nepal’s transit points with India have been closed three times since 1969. The blockade of 2015, ultimately changed the political dynamic between Nepal and India, thereby causing rift to their relationship. The third challenge is the territorial dispute between India and Nepal related to Kalapani, Susta, Lal Bakaiya. In addition to that, the dispute regarding inundation and compensation exist amongst the local inhabitants. Similarly, disputes regarding the cross-boundary occupation and settlement especially on no-one man’s land is very prevalent and is a matter of serious concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When speaking about the people experience living in this area and their challenges; majority of the people reported issues like inundation; water use/irrigation; encroachment and and/or land use for agriculture, grazing, construction; COVID-19 related disputes and differences; implicit bias and racial discrimination; and conflictual relationship between security personnel and citizens. It has been revealed that disputes and conflicts arise especially during the rainy season, when Indians restrict them to make embankments, due to the fear of flooding. The conflict escalates to an extent that people fear crossing the border to the Indian side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been discovered that, in response to the security threat, people have different perceptions about border security. Some reported issues with smuggling, trafficking in person and drugs. While an equally significant number of people cited, inability to cross the border was their paramount challenge. Other challenges were illicit border crossing by the criminals or by the third nationals, customs evasion, robbery, and smuggling of small arms, illegal trading and encroachment. When speaking about people’s experience related to Border Relation; people stated that they had a very good relationship with and across the border. About 96% of the people both male and female, stated that they crossed the border multiple times a week or month to purchase supplies, visit relatives, for business or for work. But the border closure during COVID-19 generated new types of challenges and hardship on the marginalised communities and the migrant population. It was revealed that, aside from the strong economic ties, the border inhabitants share 74% of social ties (marriage relationship or parents-children relationship) with the Indian counterpart. This social ties is not just limited to the residents of Terai region but is equally prevalent amongst Khas, Arya and Padhis. The speaker argues that the quality of inter-state relationship has a direct impact on cross border relationships, including kinship relations, behaviour of government agencies, migration and marriage trends. Past events have proved that during conflicts and disputes between the two countries, people generally tend to develop nationalistic feelings. Thus, the issues between two states are likely to hamper the relationship between its citizens including cross-border marriage and migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top level bureaucrats perceive the Nepal-India border as being “asymmetric”. According to them, the openness of the border is largely controlled by India which is a threat to Nepal’s independence and sovereignty. This understanding has shaped Nepal’s border management and immigration policies. Similar attitude is also reflected towards the Madeshi people by the federal government. Federal government often overlooks the problems of border areas or refuses to listen to the voices of people living near the border while formulating border policies. The speaker states that, current approach and attitude towards the border is affecting the poor and the marginalized the most. On the other hand, Nepali citizens residing in the border region have willingly accepted that they want to be self-reliant and are tired of excessive reliance on India. However, Nepal’s negative approach towards the border and lack of aid has compelled the border inhabitants to rely on the other side as they have no choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speaker then explained the concept of “re-bordering” and the strategies adopted for managing the open border by Nepal and India. He states that the concern for border security from both the countries have resulted in the process of “re-bordering”. The process is marked by increased budgets for law enforcement, new legislations against dangerous mobilities, deployment of cutting-edge technology, visa controls, and increased role of the military. The government of Nepal is beginning to reorganize border management through a single framework or, alternatively, a joint-mechanism—to emphasize the role of people living near the border and coordinate across three-levels of government. The speaker maintains that the current mechanisms in practice involve checking IDs, conducting foot patrols, introducing technologies, BoPs, health desks. It has been observed that these mechanisms are no longer seen as being adequate. On the other hand, India has adopted three strategies namely- working through bilateral mechanisms, enhancing security and developing infrastructure along the border and engaging in security cooperation with Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the speaker concluded the webinar by providing recommendations and viable solutions to move forward. He stressed that the government must focus on border management, livelihoods and security and political goodwill to move forward. According to him, border management and security can be improved through increased coordination and the use of infrastructure and technology. In addition to this, he stressed on empowering bilateral joint mechanisms and political leadership. He argued that 70% of issues can be solved through bilateral joint mechanisms. He further stated that, government must prioritize the concerns of marginal groups and take their voice into account while forming policies. The government must focus on strengthening gender-friendly provision and policies. The speaker view’s economic development as a long term solution to reduce migration and vulnerabilities. He insisted that border policies must address the potential vulnerabilities marginalized and vulnerable groups may have to face. He also emphasized on the role of province government and local government to improve the present situation. According to the speaker, many issues in the past have lingered because of the unwillingness of the political leadership to address them. Thus, politics, trust, understanding and dialogue is essential at this juncture rather than politics of identity and anti-nationalism.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h4>Sumeera Shrestha</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The second speaker Sumeera Shrestha added her perspective on gender and social inclusion and linked it with the issue border and border dispute. She emphasized the need to monitor and focus on the matter of gender relations border policies, gender based division of labour and gender discrimination, disability, caste and religion-based discrimination, marriage and kinship, violence and in equality. She states that, women and men of various groups and ages have been denied their human rights due to discrimination, exclusion, or limitation based on gender norms, roles, and relationships. She argues that unequal power relations creates hierarchies between men and women, causing disadvantages to one group over another and is main cause of discriminating. In addition cast system and economic disparity, has limited the participation and the engagement of people from marginalized communities, which is a form of discrimination. According to the speaker, it is very much important to focus on intersectionality as it identifies multiple factors of advantage and disadvantage of border inhabitant. The speaker then highlights the plight of daily wage workers including single women whose livelihood and health care is depended on the other side of border. She stresses that border policies must, therefore, take into account the people’s need to cross the border (i.e., for employment and supply of low-priced goods) and make the process smoother. When talking about of the labour mobility, the speaker highlighted the cases of molestation and harassment faced by women during the body inspection in the border post. The speaker insisted on bringing such issues to light and coming up-with a solution to prevent such gender based violence. The speaker also spoke about the discriminatory citizenship provision against women married to Nepali men living along the border and the social and economic hardship that comes with it. From a lack of access to government services to difficulties in obtaining their birth certificates of their offspring, that deprives them of their right to nationality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speaker emphasized on having a gender friendly policies which not only addresses but recognizes the needs of the people living close to the border. Further, she stressed on local public participants and public discussion on issues that involve prioritizing and balancing multiple policy interests linked to the border. She argues that, there is a need to study discriminatory impacts of policies like citizenship, provision of government services, and border policies on cross-border relations, especially of the Madhesis, disadvantaged groups, and minority groups.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>ChandraKishore</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The third speaker Chandrakishore stated that border relations is actually the relations between two centers; i.e. Kathmandu and Delhi in case of Nepal and India. It is the two centers that decide the fate of the borders and the people living there. Unfortunately, the centers often ignore the voices and concerns of the people living in Simanchal,i.e. the areas surrounding the borders, where the citizens from one border have their day-to-day affairs connected with the citizens across. In the case of Nepal, Kathmandu has lagged behind in prioritizing the social, human and citizenship rights of the citizens living in the borders or Simanchal. Comparatively, India has made notable efforts at improving human development and connectivity in the areas near its borders. It is important to note that the people in Simanchal have more to lose with border disputes/issues compared to the people living in the center. For example, if Nepali border is to be encroached, citizens of Kathmandu will view that as an attack on Nepal’s sovereignty. However for people living in the bordering area, border encroachment will impact their land and livelihood. Thus it becomes increasingly important to protect and prioritize the ones who live in the Simanchal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bitter picture of ignorance was seen during the Corona Crisis, when Kathmandu sealed the border. There are thousands of Nepalis living in India as laborers, and since they could not come right in, they had to jump in the Mahakali River to reach their homes. Later, as they were required to stay quarantined in India before coming home, it got expensive for them and added to the hassles. During these injustices even civil societies were found to be quiet.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Hon’ble. Malamati Rana</h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth speaker, Hon’ble Malamati Rana shared her experience and the difficulty faced by the members of her communities every now and then merely because of the fact that they are people residing in the bordering region. She emphasized on the dire need and the role of the Nepali government to improve the employment and livelihood opportunities of the people living in the border. She talked about a progressive way to move ahead with the Roti-Beti relations between Nepal and India. She stated that the concept of Roti-Beti social ties is not just limited to the residents of Terai region but is equally prevalent amongst Khas, Arya and Pahadis. However, it is just the border inhabitants who face the discriminatory consequences of inter-border marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She quoted instances where the Nepali citizens living in India for generations have acquired Aadhar card and land, while Kathmandu still hesitates to issue citizenship to border inhabitants accusing them of being Indian who may threaten national security. She questions, if India can give Aadhar card to the Nepali citizens, then why can’t Nepal give citizenship to their people who have been staying here for generations?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speaker also addressed the harassment faced especially by vulnerable farmers in the bordering areas. “We must acknowledge that Nepal is a country with very little industries: we do not even produce a needle. Thus, our livelihood is highly dependent on the open border with India.” The tension in the border affects the poor farmers the most, who do not have the means to fight for themselves. There are frequent incidents of farmers being bullied by police from both India and Nepal. While crossing the border to acquire seeds, fertilizers and soils, they are asked to produce Citizenship, Covid-19 vaccine certificates and other documents that poor farmers do not often possess. She argues, while we face such problems despite an open border, imagine the hassles transpired by a closed border? If Nepal had industry and production, it would truly be independent, and the farmers would not have to be bullied in any way. However, since we live in a nation that has to depend so much on India for even the most basic needs, it becomes increasingly important to maintain a regulated and cordial relations at the border.</p>', NULL, 2860, NULL, NULL, NULL, '/uploads/banner_image/1670736887_Nepals-Cross-Border-relations-with-China.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-12', '2021-12-08', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:19:36', '2022-12-11 17:19:47'),

Although the region has prepared local adaptation plans and practical measures, the climate impacts are overwhelming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Nepal seeks to urge the developed countries to reduce the level of carbon emissions to maintain global temperature rise within 1.5 degree centigrade.

For this issue, the Ministry of Home Affairs has informed the security agencies to initiate an integrated security plan.

The election security might be at risk due to the possibility of conflict arising by the candidates who were denied the tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The budget is allocated accordingly for the elections for the respective officials to ensure that they are well equipped with the weaponry, vehicles, manpower, and resources to tackle any challenges.

Lack of hospital beds and lack of blood in blood banks further intensified the impact of the Dengue outbreak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is disappointing seeing the lethargic approach by the government in controlling the spread of dengue.

People without access to clean water and sanitary facilities are more likely to contract water-borne infections during times of crisis.

Author Rae expressed his great passion and interest towards India-Nepal relationship, which was the motivation behind writing this book. He felt that India-Nepal relation at the moment is sub-optimal and there lies a huge potential ahead. It is very important to understand each other’s perspective to have a harmonious relationship as it is the only way to move forward. He highlighted the need to base the relationship on economic foundation, not just cultural, in order for a progressive future together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amish Mulmi emphasized on India’s soft power to strengthen the diplomatic ties between India and Nepal. He stated ‘cricket diplomacy’ as an example for India to strengthen the relationship with Nepal especially amongst its youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apekshya Shah highlighted that, poor implementation of India-backed development projects, failure of SAARC in promoting economic growth and untapped hydro power capabilities of Nepal have been detrimental to Nepal’s economy. She points out that, failure to resolve the conflicting issues through diplomatic dialogue has led to hardening of positions of Nepal India post-2015. Thus, uninterrupted diplomatic dialogue is crucial for Nepal-India ties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Lokraj Baral highlighted the lack of an India-policy in Nepal as Nepal’s biggest shortcoming in managing its international relation and foreign affairs with India. He opined that the open border’s proper regulation can strengthen Nepal-India diplomacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda) argued that it is justified for a small country like Nepal to be in constant fear of domination and fear of encroachment of land from powerful and big nations, which is omnipresent all around the world. However, Nepal needs to be wary of baseless nationalist movements and rumours in order for it to mutually benefit from the cooperation with its neighbour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Moderator and Former Ambassador, Vijay Kant Karna emphasized the culture of seeking help from India and then accusing them of micromanaging Nepal. He talked about the psychological and emotional baggage of void nationalism amongst Nepalis, which has in turn has hampered its diplomacy with India.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Details</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Ambassador Ranjit Rae opened the book discussion by addressing the seminal transformations that have taken place in Nepal in the last two- three decades. He praised Nepal by stating that while other countries have taken 100 of years for such a transformation, Nepal did it in 20-30 years. He understood the complexity of the transitional phase and respects Nepal’s efforts in the same. He admired Prachanda’s role in the transformations that have taken place in Nepal which also happens to be one of the important elements of his book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On answering as to why he wrote this book, the speaker states that, he has a great passion and interest towards India-Nepal relationship. He feels that the relationship is sub-optimal and that there is a huge potential that lies ahead. He states that, India-Nepal relationship is complex in nature, however both the countries share an intimate bond. Ambassador Rae through this book wants to inform the public about the complexity and the psychology of India-Nepal relationship which renders misunderstanding time and again. Highlighting such key-issues is important in strengthening India-Nepal relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the speaker, Indians are fond of addressing “Bhai Bhai ka rishta” with Nepal not realising that this is a sensitive issue for Nepalis. Nepal, on the other hand, wants a balanced relationship with India, and not be limited to “Bhai Bhai ka rishta”. The question then arises, does India have an unbalanced relationship with Nepal? If it is unbalanced then how would India balance it and what will be the implication of this new balanced relationship? In order to avoid such contentious question, the speaker suggests that India needs to be mindful about using the idioms while talking about its relationship with Nepal. The speaker also suggests that it is very important to understand each other’s perspective to have a harmonious relationship as it is the only way to move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ambassador emphasised on looking into the future and suggests ways to build the foundational ties between India and Nepal especially in the era when rapid transformation is taking place worldwide. According to the speaker, both the countries need to base their relationship on economic foundation which is the need of the hour and not just on the cultural aspect. The speaker suggests that both the countries have to develop their region and sub region as a common interconnected and interdependent economic space where all benefit from the collective growth. For his to happen, India and Nepal must create a condition through connectivity, through exchanges, through development of hydro-power and regional supply chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On answering the question as to why did the speaker name his book “The Kathmandu Dilemma”, he expressed that the book is actually “The Delhi Dilemma” – the dilemma that India faces while dealing with Nepal and the dynamics of foreign policies. Through this book, the author has attempted to show how decision making takes place in India; the kind of engagement and interaction that happens and how policy makers try and arrive at some common policy to reach an objective. Thus, the Kathmandu Dilemma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, he concludes by describing the cover of his book and how the picture of the clouds represents a “nuanced relationship” between India and Nepal. He maintained that India would like to have a cloudless relationship with Nepal. Further, the picture of the mountains depicted the major transition that Nepal is undergoing and its impact on the India-Nepal relationship. He wants this book to be seen as forward looking – not to be the scores of the past but build a positive foundation for future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amish Mulmi opened the book discussion by stating that the book is “timely, relevant and most importantly one of the deeply engaging books on Nepal by an Indian diplomat.” He states that, India-Nepal relationship is special, especially because of the way the border is structured; how peoples from both the countries moves across the border and the way they interact with one another. Thus, Nepal’s geography and the intimate ties with India means that Nepal have to forge a future with India and vice versa and this book tells the readers the ways to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speaker understood the dynamic of both the countries and states that in the recent times it has been increasingly evident that there are foundational shortcomings. These shortcomings are being realised from both the sides – Kathmandu and Delhi. According to the speaker, in recent times India has focused on connectivity which has been excellent but at the same time, India has witnessed weaknesses from Nepal to execute the connectivity. He supported this statement by quoting a recent example of Jainagar Railway where the absence of legal framework and policy delayed the operation of the railway. While taking about the shortcoming from the side of India, the speaker stated that, India also needs to start acknowledging that a major section of Nepali population consists of youth, under forty. India must try to understand the aspiration and wants of Nepali youth and link the Indian economy accordingly. He further suggests that, India must utilise its important weapon which is ‘soft power’. According to the speaker, if India focuses on ‘cricket diplomacy and starts supporting grass roots cricket development in Nepal, this may strength the relationship between Nepal and India and especially amongst Nepali youths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speaker concludes his speech by stating that, the policy and objective from both the ends must be well defined and clarified from the beginning. Until and unless we don’t ideate the strategies and objectives, we will continue to have issues and it will show up every now and then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apekshya Shah, opened the book discussion by stating that for someone who reads interstate relations, this book is a goldmine of information to understand the complexity of the diplomacy. She stated how the framework in which diplomacy operates varies from situations to situation on the basis of common understanding and occurs mostly behind closed doors given the sensitive nature of the interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the speaker, the writer has effectively summarised the complex and the intimate relation that Nepal-India share. The author has stressed on the need to develop an over reaching economic vision to reinforce Nepal-India relation as well as linking that to the larger region initiative such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) or BIMSTEC. According to the speaker, as a developing landlock country, Nepal has seen its growth attune to the rise of its neighbour, particularly India, given the nature of arrangement between the two economies and geography. Poor implementation of India-backed development projects, failure of SAARC in promoting economic growth and untapped hydro power capabilities of Nepal have been detrimental to Nepal’s economy. The speaker further maintained that, the Tri-lateral corporation on water and energy issues between Nepal, India and Bangladesh is overdue, especially for Nepal as the two countries are the only viable market for the surplus energy. It is a matter of concern for Nepal that despite producing surplus power it has not been able to export it. Thus, as rightly acknowledged in the book, India needs to works towards ensuring that its neighbour benefits from India’s economic growth for the relationship to be mutually beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speakers maintains that, given the increased of role of media and social media, the two countries need to be cautious of the impact non-state actors have begun to play in diplomatic relations. As it is evident from the growing anti-Indian sentiments among younger generation of Nepal. Thus, she urged that the people to people ties and the social cultural link that binds the two countries are the strength of Nepal-India ties which needs to be preserved and cherished. In addition to that, Nepal’s other foreign policy goals should be viewed in respect to its development and growth aspirations by India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speakers maintains that, given the increased of role of media and social media, the two countries need to be cautious of the impact non-state actors have begun to play in diplomatic relations.

In addition to that, Nepal’s other foreign policy goals should be viewed in respect to its development and growth aspirations by India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Lokraj Baral talked about the misunderstandings that generated between the two countries amidst the drafting of the constitution. He expressed how we should not have anti-Indian sentiments because of the mind-set of the few. He argues that, emotions and diplomacy never go hand in hand. He states that, when leaders don’t have an agenda and objective, they sell the sobbing stories to gather public sentiments. Nepal does not have India policy, when dealing with India, this is one of the biggest shortcomings from the side of Nepal. Lack of policy is also increasingly evident while dealing with the border issues. Prof. Baral is of the opinion that, open border can never be closed but should rather be regulated.<br />\r\nFormer Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda) opened the book discussion by congratulating the author for showing the courage to write about such a complex issue concerning India-Nepal relationship. According to the speaker, this book has created a wonderful opportunity for both the nations to re-build their relation and understand each other’s’ perspective. The book also provides numerous suggestions to way forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former Prime Minister maintained that, the author has written the book from the Indian perspective, which is justified considering the fact that he has been an Indian Ambassador to Nepal. Thus, while reading the book, Nepali audiences must try to analysis the text from Nepal’s perspective and not India’s. He further states that, the author has mentioned every small to big details about India-Nepal relationship to the best of his knowledge and has covered important topics like history, geography, culture, economy, development including the emotions and psychology of the Nepali people. Citing the incident of Hrithik Roshan incident which took place in the year 2000, the speakers stated that, rather than understanding the truth of the situation, few people in Nepal were easily provoked and are blinded by emotions. People deliberately vandalised the public property and caused violent public disturbance by making the situation worse in the name of defending the integrity of nation, said the speaker. The speaker then tried to analysis the psychology of the Nepali people when it comes to defending and defining nationalism. He argued that, it is justified for small country like Nepal to be in constant fear of domination, subjugation and fear of land encroachment from powerful and big nations. Such fear endures provoked nationalist movements and protests in Nepal. Such psychology is prevalent not just in Nepal but throughout the world. Thus, the speaker argued that, such psychology of nationalism is a consequence of years of historical and cultural baggage including the geographical location of Nepal. However, Nepal needs to be wary of baseless nationalist movements and rumour’s in order for it to mutually benefit from the cooperation with its neighbour. On the other hand, it is also important for both the countries to understand the psychology of one another as well as the reason for having such mental attitude, in order to build a balanced, friendly and harmonious relationship. He argued that, at this point it is also pertinent to analysis the psychology of Western Cultural which has played a major role in influencing India’s history and culture. He urged that, we have to once again analyse the positive and negative consequences of the British influence in India. Thus, at this juncture, it is important to look beyond conflicting positions to understand the interests of others that drive their behaviour. The speaker is certain that this book will spark a debate amongst the intellects of Nepal and India. Nevertheless, he hopes that the debate brings a positive role in strengthening the relationship between the nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speaker stated that, the book has an elaborative chapter on Maoist insurgency- how it begin and the reason behind it. The book also provides a clear narrative on comprehensive peace accord and the twelve-point agreement. The speaker is thankful towards the author for breaking the myth and false narrative generated by certain segment of Nepali society that “Maoists are the creation of India and are financed and trained by the Indian government.” The author has disproved this theory backed by evidence and fact, for which the speaker is immensely grateful. He talked about peaceful leadership and a major political transformation which took place in Nepal due to the effort of the Maoists backed by the comprehensive peace accord. The speaker stated that, this book is a progressive and forward looking which covers wide range of social and political issues between Nepal and India and a must read amongst the intellects. The book has provided clues to solve the existing differences between India and Nepal and ways to improve the relationship based on mutual respect for ones another’s sovereign state’s goals and ambitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ambassador Vijay Kant Karna opened the book discussion by quoting Pratap Bhanu Metha- political scientist. He said “nationalism is a poison being used by the authoritarian leaders to exploit the sentiments of the common masses for their political and authoritarian gain”. Ambassador Karna, then talked about how Nepal accuses Indian government for micro managing Nepal, but in reality, it is Nepal who has sought help from Indian embassy time and again. As Nepal till date has not been able to define nationalism, it has blamed India for every little dispute that has occurred internally. He further stated that, every little to big problem in Nepal takes the centre stage of nationalism and becomes an interest of the state. We have a habit of connecting every internal tension with the issue of nationalism which should not be the case. He talked about the psychological and emotional baggage of the nationalism amongst Nepalis and argued that, such ideology has hampered Nepal’s diplomacy with India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe speaker when talking about connectivity with India, argued that, even though China’s influence is increasing all over the world, for Nepal, the economic connectivity with China can never be similar to that of India as trade with Nepal is not China’s priority. Nepal looked upon China as an alternative to India but still Nepal was unable to conduct meaningful trade despite signing the Trade and Transit Agreement (TTA).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, the speaker talked about regulation of border and border management with India as closed border is not a viable option at this juncture. At the same time, Nepal and India shares a unique cultural and religious tie which is one of its kind.</p>', NULL, 2860, NULL, NULL, NULL, '/uploads/banner_image/1670737214_This-one-2048x1536.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-11-02', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:25:14', '2022-12-11 17:25:55'),

It has seen a significant rise in the month of September where in total 23514 cases were reported, which is a significant rise from the month of August and July, the reported cases were 3708 and 702 respectively. The substantial rise in cases from the past few months have towered over other diseases, for the reason, Ministry of Health and Population is on preparations to announce a dengue epidemic in the country. The alarming rate of spread and severity in the cases, hence, declared epidemic would necessitate the higher severity of the threat posed by the disease. Government, health institutions, and concerned authorities would be more alert to deliver in the times of crisis, and coordinate to minimize further spread of the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within a month’s time period, the dengue spread has raised concerns of blood shortage in the blood banks, paracetamol shortages and inadequacy of hospital beds. These are the basic health facilities that are fundamental to every citizen in their time of need, which the government is at the failure to provide in the current circumstances. This shows the severity of the disease spread and Nepal’s lack of health preparedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, dengue fever is shown to be a chronic problem in Nepal arising in the interval of 2-3 years, since the first case was seen in 2004. It has been highly predicted during the monsoon season. As a result, in 2019, the government announced the National Guidelines on Prevention, Management and Control of Dengue in Nepal which was first developed in 2008. Likewise, the rise in dengue cases was visible since from the past several months, the prevention campaigning was seen only to be increased this month. 38 deaths have been reported already. Even, the COVID-19 pandemic had recently pushed the health system of the country to a complete breakdown in preventing the deaths of many at the time. A series of immediate measures had to be taken to address the issues as the lack of health personnel, health facilities, health infrastructure and shortage of medical supplies which proved to be inadequate and people’s access to health care was unequal. The crisis at the hand shows the disappointment in implementing the guidelines and hesitancy on the part of the government to improve its health system over the years. Delay in improving the health systems of Nepal is a costly approach -risking many lives in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal’s way toward addressing the Climate Change issue</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 11, an event held by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, half day round table discussion on Nepal’s strategic engagement in the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) discussed the agenda faced by mountainous countries like Nepal due to rising temperature. To play a role in a global consensus on the issue of climate change which may lead to catastrophic consequences in the future, “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 ◦C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 ◦C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”, Nepal requires to follow through on its promises. COP26 which was highlighted as the “make or break” opportunity for the countries to address climate change impacts. Nepal pledged to deliver on various environmental concerns: climate change mitigation through net zero carbon emission by 2045, electric vehicles; protecting vulnerable people from climate change by 2030; and maintaining 45% of the country under forest coverage. Many applauded Nepal’s visionary pledges but have doubts about its implementation efficacy towards the goals. The lack of coordination among the three tiers of the government has experts and stakeholders concerned about implementing the commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event CoP 27, many experts have suggested holding on to the current commitments. Recommendations to Nepal declaring in a ‘state of the climate crisis, but was sidelined due to a lack of research studies to establish the truth. Nepal is also prioritising on ‘loss and damage’ agenda for the upcoming CoP27. A generic term used in UN climate negotiations, “loss and damage,” refers to the effects of climate change that people cannot adapt to or when there are solutions available but a community lacks the resources to access or take advantage of them. Loss and destruction affect vulnerable populations the most and will continue to do so, making a solution a matter of climate justice. A study by IIED, shows how Nepal is already facing loss and damage from climate change. It has been estimated that a developing country will face economic losses USD 1 – 1.8 trillion by 2050. Hence, a loss and damage agenda for Nepal might help Nepal receives finances to help mitigate the climate change issues in the country.</p>', NULL, 2811, NULL, NULL, 'Asmita Dudhraj', '/uploads/banner_image/1670737422_Melamchi_flood_031623859146_1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-09', '2022-10-21', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:25:52', '2022-12-11 18:09:12'),

The news was covered in international media stating Kathmandu city is filled with garbage as the villagers of Bancharedada protested on dumping massive due to overwhelming amount of garbage on the landfill sites. Nepal already has been ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world and now wastage management issues has contributed even more to Nepal’s international discredit. The villagers are not wrong to protest as their health is compromised, water pollution, air pollution and severe illness have been borne from the waste. Even the landfill sites were supposed to be used as a temporary place for dumping, as agreed before, but still no proper measure or alternative processing of the wastage have been determined by the government. Now, Kathmandu is facing a severe wastage management crisis adding on to already filthy roads, increased health risks, unbearable reek of organic wastage decomposing, rivers overflowing with garbage and impacting tourism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wastage disposal problem aside, the government over the years has promoted syndicate in the sector and politicized the matter. Why hasn’t the government brought attention of the people/business into attention of the people/businesses contracted for waste management? Also, there has been a term looming around these days ‘waste politics,’. In addition to this, the international community may face difficulties while visiting Nepal taking due to increased pollution. The government of Nepal and concerned authorities cannot ignore as millions of lives are at risk. Even, informal waste separation workers who are prone to deadly health hazards, should be a concern of the government. A study conducted near the landfill site has proved that its waste has countless impact on the lives of living there, and soil, air and water being polluted. The three main causes to waste management should be addressed immediately to clear out waste from the streets of Kathmandu and promote health security: management of the landfill sites, waste segregation and disposal management/recycling/ and coordination among the government institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Climate change and disasters: increased displacement in the country</span><h 2=\"\">\r\n<p>Ample studies on climate change have predicted that climate change will have severe impact on daily lives of the people, whereas, many will have to displace themselves even to sustain their livelihood. According to IDMC datasheet, Nepal already has 32,000 internally displaced people due to disasters and climate change until December, 2021. This year drought and floods have added many more to the list. Floods in the western region of Nepal, mainly Saptakoshi, has displaced over 25000 people this month. The government has also declared the area flood prone zone. It is critical matter impacting thousands of lives many left with no home, food crisis, and poverty. It has been claimed that the flood occurred due to lack of maintenance of the barrage, which is supposed to be done by India according to the agreement. This year has proved that the flood dangers are increasingly impacting the communities. It has also been estimated that the lack of weather stations in the country has proven less efficient in predicting the disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, experts concluding on lesson over the years of loss of lives and displaced families due to floods and droughtshave realized the need to install automatic precipitation stations in every infrastructure and hydropower projects for early predictions and warnings of the crisis that might befall. On August 29, Nepal signed a financing agreement of $100 million for green, resilient and inclusive development of the country. The purposes for the funds is to promote sustainable and productive use of natural capital; resilience of urban and rural infrastructure, human capital, and livelihoods to climate and environmental risks; and more efficient and cleaner production, consumption, and mobility.

It is rather concerning that new ways are adopted to smuggle drug into the country like the dark net and post offices. Recently, a news reported smuggling through the post-office has been rampant and coming from all over the world. Narcotics Control Bureau had managed to arrest several culprits in various cases using post office as means to enter drug into the country. Even though stringent laws for drugs and smuggling are available in Nepal, the numbers of cases are growing by the year. The increases in crime rate and usage of drugs by the people are heavily concerning factors to drug smuggling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dark net in recent years is wildly used for illegal activities all over the world, and Nepal is no exception to that. The advantage of it leaving very little trails, making it useful for the criminals to use it for illegal activities. A study has also shown that presence of Nepali in utilizing dark web for purchases of marijuana, opium and charas is quite visible, which was to be shipped for many different countries.Along with traditional means of bringing in drugs, as through borders and airports that impacted in country’s security has now expanded to use of cyber means and delivery through post office. Various awareness programs and operations on catching the culprits of drug smuggling has been conducted by the concerned authorities. Yet, with advancement in ways to smuggling requires increased security measures through cyber security enhancement and active involvement in dismantling the smuggling network.

Furthermore, irregular monsoon showers caused a rise temperature, mostly the hilly region, of Nepal.

It is important for the government to conduct studies on impact of climate change and agriculture optimization in the country, create strategies for water management in high rainfall seasons to meet dry seasons, and seek out climate friendly alternatives with the federal government’s support to local governments in fulfilling their responsibility in addressing these issues. On a positive note, monetary policy published on July 22, clause 104 provides to draft a ‘green taxonomy’ plan which promotes green financing and determines the required funds to address the issues.

Although vaccine request for the disease was made out to international vaccine institutes such as IVI and WHO, IVI was not able to provide the vaccines, whereas, answers from WHO is still being awaited.

Since this is the paddy plantation season, the demand for chemical fertilisers is also high. However, the government’s inability to procure adequate fertilisers to meet the demands of farmers have moved the farmers to desperation. This desperation was indicated by an incident in Dhading district where the farmers seized control and looted two trucks of fertilisers being transported to Kathmandu. Prior to this incident, the truck was taken under control by the Inland Revenue Department for importing fertilisers from India by evading the customs. During the June 13 meeting of the House of Representatives, the lawmakers have directed the government to address this issue by making fertilisers accessible to the farmers. Fertiliser crisis could further lead to food security issues and clashes/riots within the communities which could have implications for national security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the recent budget of FY 22/23, the government has allocated Rs 15 billion for fertiliser purchase. Furthermore, the government has assured that Nepal will sign a 5-year government-to-government deal with India. Although Nepal has signed various agreements with India, they have been signed on an ad-hoc basis. However, the deal will only be able to meet 30% of the annual demand. Thus, the government still doesn’t have an adequate plan to address the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal has also been exploring with the idea to produce its own fertilisers. However, according to a feasibility study conducted regarding this highlighted that the most feasible fertiliser plant would be through electricity, which would be costlier to farmers than the exported fertilisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the lack of permanent solutions, the debate has shifted towards replacing chemical fertilisers with organic fertilisers. Research has indicated that organic fertilisers can substitute chemical fertilisers for small scale farmers. However, for large scale farms, chemical fertilisers are directly linked with the productivity. Thus, transitioning to organic fertilisers will directly impact the yield of crops. However, others have argued that right kind of organic fertiliser along with the knowledge of nitrogen-fixation intercropping will improve the yield. Although organic fertilisers can be used to gradually substitute chemical fertilisers, the government should immediately focus on making the chemical fertilisers available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nijgadh Airport: Reaction to Supreme Court’s Decision</span> <h 2=\"\">\r\n<p>Supreme Court ordered the government to halt the construction of Nijgadh airport and look for the alternatives for the construction of Nijgadh International Airport, citing environmental problems. However, the full text regarding the decision is yet to be published. This decision was met with criticism from the locals of the region. Chief Minister of Madhes Province, Lal Babu Raut highlighted that the construction of the airport shouldn’t be halted. He further explained that Nijgadh airport is an important key for the development of the province. Similarly, International Relations Committee (IRC) of Lower House has instructed the government to resume the construction of the airport. IRC had prepared an annual report which highlighted that deferring the construction of the airport could have detrimental impact to the economy of the country. Furthermore, the report suggests the government to take necessary legal and administrative actions for the continuation of the process. This step of IRC has been slammed by the civil society leaders claiming that it goes against the spirit of an independent judiciary. Furthermore, the need for a second international airport is well established. Hence, the supreme court has ordered to look for alternative sites for the construction of the airport to minimise the environmental damages, rather than halting the entire project. Likewise, disagreement between different bodies relating to the implementation of the project has created confusion among the public and put the entire project in jeopardy. .</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Cyber Security</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The cases of cybercrimes have skyrocketed in the past few years. According to a police report, younger generation is increasingly becoming the victim of cybercrimes due to easy access to internet. The government had set up a National Cyber Security Monitoring Centre in 2076 and has allocated Rs 8 million in this year’s budget. However, the lawmakers have questioned the work done by the centre in order to address cyber security related issues. Furthermore, a draft bill on cyber security was made public by the Nepal Telecommunication Authority (TAN).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperts have argued that the draft bill doesn’t address the cyber issues ranging from external aggression and international litigation. Furthermore, the bill only addresses computer systems and fails to address security issues arising from cyber-attacks. Another issue arising from lack of concrete cyber laws is inflow of FDIs in the information and technology sector. According to a report, FDI pledges in the IT sector decreased by 409% in the current fiscal year. Hence, it is important that the government focuses on bringing out concrete cyber security laws to address some of the pertinent cyber related issues which would also help in raising the confidence of foreign investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Protection of Chure region</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Madhes Province has initiated ‘Chure Jogau, Madhes Bachau’ (Conserve Chure, Save Madhes) campaign and has allocated Rs 181 million for the cause. Furthermore, the government has also been reviewing the 20-year Chure-Terai Madhes conservation and management master plan. Around 5 million people live in the Chure region, and their livelihood is dependent upon the ecosystem services provided by the region, from water resources to community forestry. However, unchecked stone extraction and deforestation have caused the destruction of chure region. The impact of these activities is seen in the flooding and landslides in the region, loss of fertile land due to deposition of sand, and drying up of water sources, which has ultimately led to the desertification of terai region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHence, ‘Chure Jogau, Madhes Bachau’ campaign will focus on chure conservation through soil erosion and landslide control, reforestation programs, reservoir and pond construction, and watershed conservation, among others. Similarly, the Chure-Terai Madhes conservation and master plan is set to be completed within this fiscal year. This master plan will be significant as it will specify the roles of provincial and local bodies in the conservation of the Chure region. Although the government has set different policies to protect the region, proper implementation has hindered the conservation process. .</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</h></h2>', NULL, 2811, NULL, NULL, 'Yunish Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670737401_image-1-1.png', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-06', '2022-07-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:28:21', '2022-12-11 18:31:42'),

He is currently a freelance consultant in the areas of trade, transit, investment, private sector, and institutional development.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"color:#00FF00;\">Laxman Basnet – He is a former Executive Director at Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board under the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supply.

She also works as a Chief Board Advisor of Human Rights Journalists’ Association (HURJA).</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The first speaker, Mr. Purushottam Ojha argued that TTA should be developed as a safety valve in an event of crisis such as embargo or blockade. He talked about the factors affecting TTA agreement and ways to improve the connectivity with China. The three factors that he highlighted regarding the TTA agreement were distance between the seaports and the border, time and cost of using the transit system, and lack of proper road infrastructure in Nepal side. Furthermore, he highlighted that the TTA agreement is incomplete. It doesn’t include the details about customs, insurance, and liability and these details have been left at the discretion of Chinese officials. It is important to understand that different cargos need different procedures, in terms of liability, insurance, and cost. So, Mr. Ojha insists that without the incorporation of these details in the agreement, the agreement will remain incomplete.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Ojha then highlighted four key points to improve the TTA between Nepal and China. The first point that he emphasized was to develop procedures to improve the transit. One of the ways to improve the transit is through trial run process which would help estimate the total time and cost. The next point that he emphasized to improve the TTA is through regular dialogues between the government. He pointed that there have been many agreements between Nepal and China which haven’t been implemented in action, one of them being zero tariff agreement. Thus, he highlighted the importance of regular dialogues for proper implementation of agreements. Similarly, he also stressed the need for our own internal transit policy which could be then used to further transit policies between other nations. Finally, he also highlighted the need to improve physical connectivity with Nepal and focus on the development of North-South corridor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second speaker, Mr. Laxman Basnet started his discussion by highlighting the history of transit facilities to landlocked country which was initiated in the UN convention of 1982. Then he touched on the time frame taken to finalize the TTA (around 3 years). He explained that time frame taken to finalize the agreement is a setback to the country. Similarly, he highlighted the need to shift away from Rasuwa and Tatopani border points and establish Mustang as a main transit point. He pointed the fact that there is no clarity on Rasuwa and Tatopani road improvement. Furthermore, the geography of Rasuwa and Tatopani is very challenging in comparison with that of Mustang, which makes it a good border transit point to North. Finally, he also added that the involvement of private sector is important to enhance the connectivity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third speaker, Ms. Namrata Sharma touched on the importance of proper homework and preparation from Nepali delegation that would benefit the Nepali people. She highlighted that the past agreements have missed important bits and pieces which have ultimately affected the people of Nepal. Finally, she added that any agreement including TTA should be properly analyzed to examine how it benefits the people of Nepal and the environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo conclude, all the speakers have highlighted the need for investment in domestic infrastructure and capacity building so that Nepal can become a transit state for its neighbors. One of the ways to enhance the investment is by attracting the private sector. Similarly, to improve the TTA, the speakers have pointed out the importance of understanding and researching the modalities for the movement of goods through Chinese territories. Finally, the need for transit policies for better negotiations in the future was also highlighted.</p>', NULL, 2860, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670737526_Nepals-Connectivity-with-China-Status-and-Prospect.-2.png', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-10', '2021-10-07', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:30:26', '2022-12-11 17:31:17'),

Since 2006, a total of three elections have been held, together with the election for two Constituent Assemblies and one for the House of Representatives. However, out of the total 126 castes, 62 castes including Kusunda, Nurang, Raute, Kalar, Lohorung, Balul, Chidimar have never been represented in the House of Representatives so far, cited a soon-to-be published report of the National Inclusion Commission, a constitutional body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgetting the purpose of the Proportional Representation, leaders seem to have manipulated the same for their benefit. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s wife, Aarju Rana has occupied the women’s quota, UML leader Raghuji Panta occupied the Khas-Arya quota, and Bimalendra Nidhi – the Madhesi quota. A complaint was filed on 6th of October, pleading the election commission to investigate upon the list submitted by the parties citing it to be against the principle of inclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to the representation of the other gender, the situation is, sadly, not different. Time and again the transgenders or the ‘other’ genders have had to face hurdle because of their gender identity. In 2013, Bhumika Shrestha got a seat in Nepali Congress and was nominated for the second Constituent Assembly in the Proportional Representation quota. While her name was recommended for the federal election in 2017, she was asked to forfeit as her citizenship name stated as ‘Kailash Shrestha.’ Dilu Buduja – a transgender man, who is contesting election this year from Madhav Kumar Nepal’s CPN (Unified Socialist) Party, was barred from contesting local level elections in 2017 at his home district of Myagdi as his citizenship was issued under the ‘third’ category. Together with Dilu Buduja, Shilpa Chaudhary – a transgender woman, are nominated this year for the House of Representative by CPN (Unified Socialist).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Sandeep Lamichhane Under Arrest</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Suspended cricket captain Sandeep Lamichhane was arrested upon arrival at the Tribhuwan International Airport on October 6th, 2022. After investigation, the Metropolitan Police Circle, where Lamichhane has been convicted, recommended a jail term of at least 12-years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 219 of the Criminal (Code) Act, 2017 states that if someone engages in sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent or with a minor girl below 18 years with her consent, it will be taken as rape. Submitting their report to the Kathmandu District Attorney Office on October 23rd, 2022, the Metropolitan Police Circle found that Lamichhane had indeed raped the minor. The police also recommended ‘appropriate compensation’ for the victim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since last few months, actor Paul Shah has also been under arrest for similar reasons. While Lamichhane is yet to be tried at the court, this incident and its wide media coverage brought much needed awareness regarding statutory rape, in particular.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Comedian Apoorwa Kshitiz Bailed</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Comedian Apoorwa Kshitiz, who was arrested on August 28th, 2022, was ordered release on bail of Nrs. 250,000 by the Kathmandu District Court. Four different cases against him were filed by the government attorney at the Kathmandu District Court. Kshitiz is facing charges for hurting the sentiments of Newa people, after some activists filed a complaint claiming that his performance disrespected the community and culture. He claimed that the sole purpose of his performance was to make people laugh and also issued an apology video. However, the police arrested him nonetheless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts claim that his arrest might have a political motive. With the election approaching, parties are looking for an agenda to politicize and cash votes. When compared with many other Nepali comedians in the past, who have offended a community one way or the other, Kshitiz’s arrest seemed to be biased.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Prashanti Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670738729_Election-campaign-Nepal-1-1-1.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-10', '2022-11-10', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 17:50:29', '2023-01-05 15:38:31'),

The latest report shows a significant increase in the country’s foreign exchange (forex) reserve for the first time in 15 months. Such a consistently negative growth of the reserve is a remarkably rare occurrence, and it has brought into light the country’s vulnerability to a dire economic crisis.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Why is the forex reserve important?</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Forex reserve, the stock of foreign-denominated cash or assets held by a country’s monetary authority, expands with activities that bring foreign currency to the country (e.g., exports, remittance, foreign grants) and shrinks with activities like imports and external debt servicing. In a global order guided by economic integration through trade and financial transactions, all countries hold foreign currency. But for Nepal, a small import-oriented economy amidst a global melt-down, having a sound forex reserve is especially important.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal is a country that relies on imports for the availability of most essential and intermediate goods. Since importers pay in foreign currency, the forex reserve indicates a country’s ability to finance imports. Moreover, the majority of Nepal’s imports comes from India (around 70% according to the latest NRB report), and a fixed exchange rate with the Indian currency has historically fostered eased trade and price stability. However, without a sizable reserve of foreign currency, the central bank is unable to maintain the market’s confidence that it will exchange Nepali currency for a foreign currency at the given/fixed rate. As such, the country’s foreign exchange reserve is also instrumental in adding credibility to the currency regime.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Understanding the decline in forex reserves</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The decline in Nepal’s forex reserve is an amalgam of many factors. On one hand, channels of foreign currency injection have been fairly stagnant. Workers’ remittance, the largest source of foreign currency, was Rs. 897 billion in the eleven months of 2021/22, just a 3.65% increase from the previous fiscal year. Likewise, foreign grants decreased from Rs. 23 billion to Rs. 6.4 billion, whereas net foreign direct investment increased by 7% to Rs. 17 billion.<br />\r\nIn contrast, an outflow of foreign currency, mainly through imports, is increasing. The trade deficit, already on an increasing trend since August 2020, showed a 25% growth in the latest NRB report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rising prices and USD’s appreciation are the main factors pushing up the cost of imports and exacerbating trade deficit – the value of the country’s top import, petroleum products, increased by 89% this fiscal year compared to the previous year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInflation, which had been surging globally since 2020 due to supply chain disruptions induced by COVID, has been further intensified by the conflict in Ukraine. Rising prices in the international market has persisted for much longer than anticipated and continues to reach record-high levels in emerging as well as advanced economies. Kristalina Georgieva, chair and managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in a recent blog post, recognized the prolonged threat of global inflation and projected a downturn in global economic growth for 2022 and 2023.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNRB’s report does not necessarily suggest alarm for a crisis though. As economies recover from the pandemic, tourist arrivals are picking up and Nepal’s tourism sector is growing. Likewise, the number of migrant workers going abroad increased by over 400% this fiscal year compared to the previous – we can expect increased remittance income in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegardless, the forex reserve is expected to be in a crunch in the coming future as only last month, NRB reported that the reserve was enough to finance merchandise and services imports for a record low of 6.6 months. Further, citing lack of improvement in the reserve, the government extended its 81-day ban on the import of certain goods by one and a half months.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Policy and way forward</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Policymakers are unable to control the international market, but they can respond by pacifying domestic demand. Likewise, the outflow of foreign currency can be reduced by “cooling down” the economy through austerity measures. Central banks globally raising interest rates to incentivize people against domestic consumption to slow demand is an example of this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe recently published monetary policy by NRB too employs contractionary tools to reel in domestic demand. For example, the policy interest rates, the rates used by the central bank to influence other banks and financial institutions’ (BFI) interest rates, have all been raised by 1.5%. As BFIs follow and increase lending rates, the public is incentivized to save more and reduce consumption, thus slowing demand. This consequently refers to a reduction in the demand for imports, relieving trade deficit and forex reserve.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGeorgieva’s blog urged that fiscal policies should support and not hinder Central Banks’ efforts during these trying times. The expansionary fiscal budget proposed for the next fiscal year, amid increased expenditures for federal and provincial elections, poses a challenge to the monetary policy. Further, with the Finance Minister having resigned and NRB’s Governor being pressured to do the same following allegations raised against them, policymakers’ diligence and impartiality is under question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Nepal’s foreign exchange reserve does not face immediate adversity, without appropriate policies and coordination between government authorities, the economy remains vulnerable to a crisis.</p>', NULL, 2883, NULL, NULL, 'Aayushma Manandhar', '/uploads/banner_image/1670740329_ibrahim-boran-_aUwE2DnIPg-unsplash-1920x1280.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-07', '2022-07-28', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 18:17:09', '2022-12-11 18:17:09');

On July 22, the lower house of the parliament approved the Citizenship Act 2006 Amendment Bill while the upper house on July 28. The Speaker then forwarded the bill to Sheetal Niwas on July 31 for validation from the President. However, President Bidya Devi Bhandari sent it back for review laying out a series of 15 concerns associated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the lasting solutions should be found to the issue of naturalized citizenship, the President had raised. The issue of naturalized citizenship is close to the Madhesi population and in her message, the President made clear, that it should be resolved in a permanent way. However, experts believe that President Bhandari is attempting to facilitate the CPN-UML’s political agenda by using the issue of citizenship to garner nationalistic sentiments amongst voters at the upcoming provincial and federal elections. KP Sharma Oli had attempted similar move in 2015, using the Indian blockade to portray himself as an anti-Indian, nationalistic leader. That in turn had helped him to win the election in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After consulting legal experts and civil society members, President Bhandari held meetings with retired and incumbent army officials together with the home minister – Bal Krishna Khand on August 25, 2022. Khand expressed that the President and the CPN-UML were trying to politicize upon the matter, citing that the amendment bill is no different than the ordinance passed earlier in May 2020 during the KP Sharma Oli administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until now, all of the President’s decisions are within the constitution, however, they are partisan in nature and in favor of CPN-UML. Now that the President has just one constitutional option, which is to authenticate the bill, meeting with the army officials, especially, at the Sheetal Niwas seems redundant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Fight for Justice</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Rape survivor, Niharika Rajput attempted self-immolation in front of the President’s Office at Sheetal Niwas on August 12, 2022. Rajput, demanding justice, was on hunger strike, claiming that Shivaraj Shrestha – a resident of Kshireshwarnath Municipality-3, Mahendra Nagar – repeatedly raped her and impregnated her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 2, 2020, Rajput had reached Dhanusha District Court to appeal her case, but the court decided that the existing evidence could not establish the crime against the accused. Rajput then gave birth to her son on August 21, 2020. She then reached Janakpur High Court demanding justice, but to no avail. After that, Rajput came to Kathmandu and approached the National Human Rights Commission. She started a hunger strike demanding a DNA test claiming that Shrestha is actually her baby’s father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 12, Rajput returned home upon being assured that her demands to be met. Government officials including Joint Secretary Shivaram Pokharel and Under Secretary Basanta Bhattarai, both representing the Home Ministry, had signed a five-point agreement before she decided to end her fast-unto-death</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rights activists cite many hurdles for rape survivors while seeking justice. Not only are they subjected to statutory limitation while appealing their case, but lack of evidence also gets in the way. Since rapes often lack evidences due to technicalities, rape survivors often reach to such extremes as Rajput in search for justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Viral Dance Step</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>On August 23, 2022, @priyanka_oli, a Tiktok user, uploaded a video featuring six young Nepali women, serving as health workers at Babai Rural Municipality, Dang, dancing to Katrika Kaif and Siddharth Malhotra-starrer, ‘Kala Chasma.’ The video clip featured five women grooving behind whilst one woman twerking – laying on all fours and thrusting her hips upwards and downwards. The video quickly went viral garnering 853,000 views within five-days of getting uploaded. The comments however were far from supportive. ‘You should take them out of their jobs. How will such women give any services?’ were some of the remarks shared by the viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>@priyanka_oli, then deleted the video in question and uploaded a new video wherein all women involved apologized to the audience for ‘overstepping the line demarcated by society’ and promising to ‘stay within the dignity of our roles.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choreography copied and enacted by numerous Nepali social media users, including @priyanka_oli, was first uploaded by TheQuickStyle, a Norwegian hip-hop dance crew. However, the instant women began to copy the dance moves, ‘moral polices’ labelled the moves, ‘anti-national’ and ‘those best fit for bars’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gender experts cite this kind of moral policing as a way of controlling women. The health workers in question claim to have been praised for their act of kindness earlier in their Tiktok videos, but a mere dance move deemed them as immoral. With Teej itself gaining mixed sentiment with some arguing for and some against, these moral policing over something as harmless as dance moves certainly brings into question as to how far can the society go to control women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">‘Nepal Ahead in LGBTQI rights,’ says Stern</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>On an official five-day visit from August 10 to 14, Jessica Stern, the US Department of State’s Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons, visited Nepal.

Nepal encountered high inflation (Inflation based-CPI jumped to 7.28 % in April 2022 and to 7.87 % last May on y-o-y basis). While Nepal relies mainly on imports and due to the inflation, the import’s price hikes resulted in a depreciation of the NRP as well as a significant compression of foreign reserves.

To cope with inflation, companies decided to “downsize” – also referred to as shrinkflation. It consists in reducing products package’s size, which people hardly notice while maintaining the same price. This strategy has been implemented since the 1970s and knew a surge after 2008. This way companies can better cope with production costs surge while avoiding loss of competitiveness. The chore of the strategy lies in that consumer are more price conscious rather than ‘weight conscious’, especially when the labels have been changed in a more discrete one, making the downsizing less obvious. This strategy is used globally by companies in the US, and the UK – where inflation is particularly high (between 6 to 8%). India, also experiencing a similar level of inflation, has seen its companies like Clinic Plus, Parle, or Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) implementing this business strategy focusing on poor rural areas.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Why shrinkflation seems to be the safest option for retailers?</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>When a company’s production costs increase, it mainly has three options: produce smaller packages, change the ingredients, or raise the price of the final product. In our economic context, changing ingredients can be quite risky. Indeed, changing ingredients means using cheaper ingredients which deteriorates the product’s quality. Another option is to raise prices. Given the current economic health, increasing price is not an option. So, getting packages smaller seems to be the safest for business at the moment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the other side, on the customer’s level, shrinkflation also affects consumers’ shopping habits. Already because of inflation, consumers focus their consumption on the most important items: groceries, electricity, and fuel. Also, as reported in an article of the NPR, some decide pragmatically to buy the whole piece of cheese instead of buying the pre-sliced one. Further, retailers have identified new trends in consumer habits as reported by the Times of India. Downsizing the package makes consumers ‘look for packs that offer value’. This is why, HUL, has decided to create and produce bridge packs (between two price points) ‘to provide the right price-value equation to its consumers, ensuring that products remain affordable and accessible’.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">This practice has pushed consumers rights association to speak up …</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Even if this business strategy is not illegal, it remains tricky. For that specific reason, concealing the price hinders consumer rights. This practice affects the ability of the consumer to make informed choices. Indeed, given the small difference in size between the previous and new products, the consumer is not able to notify the change, and thus chose which product is the most suitable for them. This is one of the reasons why some Consumer Protection associations advise looking at the price per kilo instead of the price of the product. In an interview to CESIF, Mr. Hari Prasad Mainali, secretary of the Forum For Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal, restated the Article 44-1 of the Constitution stating that “every consumer shall have the right to obtain quality goods and services”, which rights have been reassured by 2074’s Consumer Act. According to Ratula Chakraborty, professor of business management at the University of EastAnglia, suppliers, and retailers should be obliged to notify the customer that the product has been downsized through a label for a period of at least one month.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">… for valid reasons.</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, companies may use marketing to justify such business strategies: praising the lower environmental cost of the package, standing for the health of the consumers as it limits ‘passive’ overeating, or supporting the innovatoin of the brand for a more efficient product. However, this practice questioned the choices and strategies used by these companies after food giants realized huge profits during the pandemic. Indeed, last may an OXFAM report revealed that 62 new food billionaires have been created over the last two years while global food prices have spiraled by over 30% . Thus, it widely questions the necessity to adopt such practices as shrinkflation. Meanwhile, chairman of Rasna Group, Piruz Khambatta and Sahil Gilani, Gits Food Products Sales &amp; Marketing Director, declared to the Times of India that they won’t be running any promotional offers given they are already absorbing cost inflation. S.Charlebois, professor of Food Distribution and Policy, Dalhouse University, reported his doubts in an article for The Conversation regarding the tendency of this business strategy to contribute to inflation. Indeed, we refer to it as an “invisible inflation” because it challenges statistics to get adjusted sufficiently and efficiently, making this inflation more vicious.</p>', NULL, 2883, NULL, NULL, 'Maela Merrer', '/uploads/banner_image/1670740558_bannershrinkflation.png', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-07', '2022-07-07', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 18:20:58', '2022-12-11 18:21:14'),

While the Prime Minister alongside his Indian counterpart – Narendra Modi reviewed many projects of mutual benefits including political, economic, trade, energy, security and development issues; the one that stood out the most was the agreement for hydropower development. According to Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), the two countries have agreed on a ‘Joint Vision Statement on Power Co-operation/Common Vision Agreement’, aimed at benefitting both countries by strengthening employment generation, enhancing export earnings and furthering capacities of energy/power industries.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FFA500;\">Commentary</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>The new agreement between Nepal and India has increased means for electricity trade from Nepal; expanding the country’s energy exporting prospects above the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). Through the agreement, the two neighbors have agreed to develop hydro projects through joint investments, construct inter-country transmission lines, develop bi-directional power trade with appropriate access to electricity markets and coordinate operations of national grids. Overall, the new agreement has been hailed as a breakthrough achievement for Nepal in its energy trade, yet many challenges remain for the proper implementation of the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal is still dependent on India for its domestic energy demands during the winter season, whereas it generates excess (surplus) energy during the rainy season. Yet a major portion of this energy ends up wasted with due to lack of access to market. According to Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA), around Nrs. 5 million worth of electricity was wasted in the last fiscal. As of present, India buys electricity from only the 24 MW Trishuli and 14 MW Devighat projects. Moreover, with the completion of new projects including – Upper Tamakoshi, Marsyangdi, Upper Bhotekoshi, Trishuli and Devighat projects, Nepal is expected to have a surplus energy of approximately 621 MW during the monsoon season. However, India is still reviewing Nepal’s proposal to sell electricity from these projects. Considering this, whether India agrees to buys surplus energy from Nepal under the Common Vision Agreement remains unanswered; further casting doubt over its implementation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, the amount of capital to be invested by both the countries remains unclear. While the two countries have agreed for mutual investment; Nepal severely lacks budget/revenue for large-scale infrastructure development demanded by the power sector. Likewise, export to third country (Bangladesh) via India (transboundary transmission line) is also uncertain. A few years back, GMR Group (Grandhi Mallikarjuna Rao, an Indian multi-national company) was licensed by Nepal government to export 500 MW of energy from the 900 MW Upper Karnali to Bangladesh. However, the company is yet to export energy from Nepal to Bangladesh via India due to approval hassles. In this view, the likelihood of exporting electricity under the Common Vision Agreement rests dubious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSumming up, while private sector businessmen and industrialist are delighted with the Common Vision Agreement and have praised Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of concluding a fruitful bilateral visit; implementing and capitalizing of the provisions under the agreement seems rather challenging, with concrete homework to be initiated.</p>', NULL, 2883, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670740747_NP_KTM_20220401_NP_KTM_20220401_0D3A1220-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-04', '2022-04-13', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 18:24:07', '2022-12-11 18:24:07'),

Similarly, the country can purchase 170,000 tons in the second year, followed by 195,000 tons in the third and 210,000 tons in both the fourth and fifth year.

Fertilizer supply has always been acutely low in Nepal, particularly due to its high dependency on both formal and informal imports to sustain its internal/domestic demand. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoALD), Nepal’s total demand for chemical fertilizer stands at 600,000 metric tons (MT) (as of February 2022), wherein 25 percent is domestically produced and the rest 75 percent is imported from neighboring nations. Within the same figure, one-third of the total demand is imported through formal channels and the rest via informal procedures such as illegal cross-border smuggling. While the government has assigned two state-owned companies – the Agriculture Inputs Corporation Limited (AICL) and the Salt Trading Corporation Limited (STCL) to import and distribute chemical fertilizers (at a subsidized rate); their inefficiency, lackluster management practices, procurement discrepancy and corruption has plagued the farming sector. Moreover, the duo-monopoly exerted by them has profoundly restricted private companies from entering the fertilizers market. In addition, the existence of a cartel culture, presence of middlemen and heavy customs duty has also demotivated private companies and enterprises. All of this has left the fertilizer market unregulated with severe product crunch; ultimately hampering farmers – their produce and their productivity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgriculture is the main driver of Nepal’s economy, contributing around 25 percent to the national economy and employing around 60 percent of the total workforce (as of February 2022). Yet farmers always bear the brunt of inadequate chemical fertilizers and plant nutrient supply during harvest/crop season. Considering this, the MoU signed by Nepal with India is anticipated to lessen the woes of domestic farmers and producers. However, the nation cannot completely rely on it to fulfill its fertilizers needs. Newer avenues must be adopted to prevent future fertilizer crisis/crunch including – stronger G2G negotiations with other fertilizers exporting countries such as China, Turkey, Egypt, and the Gulf nations to reduce import dependency on India; storing buffer stocks to ensure fertilizer supply even during desperate or unforeseeable periods; strengthening both procurement procedure and human resource management at AICL and STCL particularly with regards to imports; ensuring equitable distribution channels by acknowledging the role of private sector in fertilizers market; and encouraging private investments in domestic fertilizer industries.</p>', NULL, 2883, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670740974_KN_Damauli-suntalabikritayariphoto1-scaled.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-03', '2022-03-10', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 18:27:54', '2022-12-11 18:27:54'),

By focusing on policies of transforming the economy from the current import-based model to an income-oriented model, the new bill aims to channel remittances into fruitful domestic and internal productive sectors; reviving micro- and small-scale businesses who were particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent lockdowns. In particular, the ‘Make in Nepal- Swadeshi’ campaign as introduced in the new bill looks promising for the industrialization, commercialization and development of the traditional industries of Nepal to a more productive and innovative one. The new budget has also touched upon the need to address the ballooning trade deficit of the country which has nearly left the nation coffer practically empty and had reduced the Balance of Payments surplus by Nrs. 281.18 billion (USD 2.38 billion). For this, the new bill has laid provisions to preserve and identify domestic products that have comparative advantage in the international market by providing subsidy and seeds to industries that produce goods from domestically sourced raw materials.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYet the new bill seems unguided in terms of its implementation. With a growing faction of opposition party dissatisfied with the introduction of the new bill, its practicality and execution remains ambiguous. Although the budget mostly focuses on procuring COVID-19 vaccines and building the necessary infrastructure to ensure medical facilities and services; procurement plan and procedures remains largely absent. Similarly, the provision of low-cost meals and monetary support to 500,000 families seems widely vague. According to a report published last month by the National Planning Commission (NCP) titled ‘Nepal: Multidimensional Poverty Index 2021’, there are currently 18 million people in Nepal (roughly 63.5 percent of the total population) who are facing deprivation of some form in area of multidimensional poverty. Considering this, the monetary aid programme under the replacement budget seems blindly targeted, brought in without conducting any preliminary ground work in identifying individuals across the nations who need monetary aid the most; rendering it similar to the previous populist announcements made to secure electoral votes rather than ensuring welfare of the targeted groups. Likewise, the government’s overtly ambitious growth target of 7 percent seems a distant dream considering the current micro-, macro- and financial-situation of the economy. With international organizations like Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicting Nepal’s growth target to remain at a provisional estimate of 3 percent to 4 percent; the new growth target seems candidly exaggerated. For instance, the government has earmarked Nrs. 378.1 billion (USD 3.21 billion) for capital expenditure which is an increment of only Nrs. 4 billion (USD 33.98 million) (as compared to the previous financial plan laid out by the Oli government); leaving behind huge gaps in the public-private expenditure ratio in meeting the growth target.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinister Sharma has also failed in downsizing public and domestic debt of the country as per the general expectation. While Sharma vehemently criticized the previous government in failing to reduce both the components (in his August 10 White Paper), the minister himself has only reduced public and domestic debt by Nrs. 37 billion (USD 314 million) and Nrs. 11 billion (USD 93 million), which is not adequate enough to avoid any unforeseeable liquidity crisis that may arise in the economy. The budget has also exerted immense pressure on the collection of revenue. Minister Sharma aims to generate Nrs. 1.05 trillion (USD 8.92 billion) from revenues yet the state mechanism to do so has not been clear i.e. the federal government is yet to allocate rights and policy framework to sub-national governments in carrying tasks and responsibilities assigned to them.

The first legal recognition of the LGBTQI+ community was established by the interim constitution of Nepal, 2063 which guaranteed the rights of each individual right to freedom, equality and right against discrimination. The 2015 Constitution of Nepal has carried the same values protecting the rights of minorities. A landmark decision by the supreme court on the Sunil Babu Pant vs. GoN and others was a victory for LGBTQI+ rights establishment in Nepal. The verdict provided with recognition of nonbinary gender, eliminating any discriminatory laws against the LGBTQI+ community and forming a committee to study the possibility of same-sex marriage. In 2013, a category of other gender was introduced while obtaining citizenship and included on passports 2 years later. Yet, the discussion still persists on whether the laws are enough. Laxmi Ghalan who is the founder of mitni Nepal expressed that “LGBTQI+ people are reporting an elevated risk of domestic and family violence, increased social isolation and anxiety, and difficulties in accessing crucial sexual and reproductive health rights,” said Laxmi Ghalan, founding member of Mitini Nepal. The conservative perceptions, social stigma and stereotyping of the community have devalued people’s right to a dignified life and freedom of choice. Even though Nepal is said to be progressive on the matter, it has a long way to go until the LGBTQI+ community feels recognised and respected as citizens of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Controversial Citizenship amendment bill</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Since August 2018, among the pending bills in the house, a bill to amend the citizenship act is one of them. The Supreme Court had ordered not to implement the Citizenship amendment bill stating it would have future implications. With the nearing of federal and provincial elections, the ruling coalition held a meeting over the pending bill with plans of tabling it in the house. It is a very sensitive issue as citizenship is the basis on which people receive education, acquire and sell properties, voting rights, and banking facilities. Many people are currently stateless in the country unable to exercise basic human rights. Nepal citizenship Act 2006 provides unsatisfactory and discriminatory provisions that requires amendment.The existing provision on foreign women married to Nepali men could attain naturalised citizenship, but the proposed bill has extended the time period to 7 years. This not only raises the issue of unequal provisions provided to men and women as foreign married to Nepali women have to wait 15 years to acquire the same, but this also has the possibility of impacting the relationship between Nepal and India due to the majority of foreigners marrying in the country are from India.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Undermining women’s and LGBTIQ+ individual’s autonomy</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the citizenship act has provided for the woman to provide her child citizenship through descent, yet if the father is a foreigner, the child shall receive naturalised citizenship. This is not applicable if the mother is a foreigner. Similarly, if a father is not present and a child has to receive citizenship through his/her mother, the mother has to declare the father ‘unknown’. This completely undermines women’s rights and their autonomy. The fact that a woman’s existence is still connected to a man exerts government favouring patriarchal norms and values through legal provisions and is contradictory and discriminatory compromising our constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the amendment bill has further proposed for the LGBTQI+ community to acquire citizenship as ‘other’, if the medical evidence of sex change is provided. Such provision is only in favour of the people who are able to afford sex-change surgery, and even if one could it is a very risky procedure for one to be forced to go through. The decision to want to go through surgery should be on the individual and not imposed by the state for recognition. Recognition of one’s gender identity should be provided with no conditions. The case of Ruksana Kapali, biologically born as a boy but identifies her as a girl, sheds light on limitations of freedom on right to dignified life, choice of identity and right to education. The term other is not inclusive of LGBTQI+ community. The people from the community have shown discontent on the matter as people identifying themselves as non-binary would like to be referred to as ‘X’, transgender as ‘T’, and some intersex and transgender would like to identify themselves as male or female. The forceful nature of the citizenship bill to identify all as others deprives them of their fundamental rights. Existing Act and the amendment bill both are viewed as rather patriarchal and regressive. The citizenship act amendment bill needs rigorous study and discussion before being passed in the parliament. Accepting the bill as it would promote inequality, labelling a community and especially unconstitutional.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Legal age for Marriage conundrum</span></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the discussion of removing limitation in filing for rape cases, Minister Govinda Bandi, Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, have raised concerns over the marrying age of man and woman being 21 and 20 respectively. He spoke in a meeting held among the house of representatives saying the allocated age has rather increased penalising individuals for child marriage. He argued that it is not standard to have to wait until 20 to get married. The provided legal age for marriage gives women no power to decide over the will to marry till the age of 20, which according to case studies have rather been used as parental control to children eloping through filing cases against the man for child marriage and rape. The global standard for marriage age is 18 years old, and Nepal has legal voting and consent rights at the age of 18, which would make sense to lower the legal age as well to 18. Nevertheless, in a developing country like Nepal where women’s health rights, early marriage and dropout rate are still a great matter of concern, having the legal age for marriage higher would allow for better protection of them., A study conducted by Human Rights Watch has linked early marriages to poverty and majority of people practising early marriages are from the marginalised and poor communities. Hence, it would be best if the government had concerns on eradicating poverty, uplifting marginalised communities and protecting women rights over decreasing the legal age for marriage. This will only decrease the statistics for child marriage and rape cases, but will not solve the core problem existing in the society as women health reproductive health, forcible marriages, women dropouts in education, and poverty eradication.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Asmita Dudhraj', '/uploads/banner_image/1670741503_1000_11622782130_1200.jpeg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-06', '2022-07-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 18:36:43', '2022-12-11 18:36:43'),

She holds a Postgraduate Degree in Diplomacy and Foreign Policy from City, University of London.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Purushottam Ojha opened the webinar by highlighting that from the perspective of economic diplomacy, the areas of interest for Nepal to be meaningfully engaged with the two neighbors are trade and investment, transit and connectivity, tourism, development cooperation, and the implementation of treaties and agreements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe speaker said that while India and China make up for 3/4th of the Nepal’s total trade volume, the trade deficit Nepal incurs with both neighbors is unsustainable. If we are to refer to figures of last three years, there is a huge gap between import and export, he said. He added that in South Asia, Nepal is among the bottom most countries receiving foreign direct investment (FDI) despite having huge potential. He explained that while China and India are the biggest sources of FDI in Nepal, the outflow to Nepal is negligible in comparison to their outflow of FDI to other countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe speaker also argued that transit and connectivity are more significant from the perspective of a landlocked country and although newer concepts such as ‘landlocked to land-linked’ are being propounded in Nepal, there has been little progress. He highlighted that while Nepal has signed various treaties and agreements with its both its neighbors, there has either been no implementation or it has been utterly delayed. For instance, Nepal signed the agreement of transit and transportation with China in 2019; however, it is not yet operational. Similarly, while India and China have been development cooperation partners of Nepal for a long time, signed agreements remain dormant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ohja cited that 36% of the 1.2 million tourists that visited Nepal in 2019, were from India and China. He said that although numbers fell significantly in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a great potential for revival and even increasing the number of tourists. He suggested that economic diplomacy could play a major role in this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Bijendra Man Shakya opened by stating that the scope of economic diplomacy is so broad and comprehensive that it covers issues ranging from trade, investment, and migration, which he also referred to as the three basic components of globalization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regard to trade with Nepal’s neighbors, he said that while trends in figures with China seem irregular, figures with India from the past few years are smoother in comparison and show hope for change in terms of volume of trade. Regardless, unfavorable trade deficit and imbalance in which Nepal finds itself should be a focus in economic and trade diplomacy. He added that it should be given priority and tackled through formulation of trade policy, trade strategy, and economic diplomacy. He also argued that trade deficits do not simply occur because of interventions made by trading partners and that it is more of a domestic issue. He added that there is little talk on how to overcome trade deficit practically. Therefore, the role of economic diplomacy is key to overcome challenges of this nature. The speaker also pointed out that with respect to trade, Nepal has not been able to tap into favorable bilateral trading arrangements and preferential treaty arrangements with either of its neighbors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Shakya then explained that effective economic diplomacy would allow Nepal to negotiate favorable terms and conditions such as removal of trade barriers. He added that currently, Nepal’s preference utilization is far from desirable and that Nepal has been unsuccessful in exploiting two of the largest and most lucrative markets despite being so close in proximity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe speaker highlighted that Nepal’s policy makers and diplomats have overlooked the role the private sector could play in facilitating economic diplomacy. He argued that even if the government makes the agreements and heads negotiations, the private sector is the main actor as they create business, trade, and investment. Therefore, there cannot be an expansion in trade and investment without considering the role of the private sector.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs Apekshya argued that one cannot ignore the failure of regional processes when talking about economic diplomacy with Nepal’s neighbors. She added that South Asia is the least integrated region, so doing business in the region is expensive. As a result, countries of the region trade more with distant countries than within the SAARC region which is all the more detrimental to landlocked countries like Nepal and Bhutan because they trade the most within the region. She suggested that pushing regional initiatives are important for a long-term connectivity opportunities and also because international markets can be very intimidating for developing countries like Nepal. She also suggested that regional forums that can open economic opportunities for Nepal should not be ignored.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe speakers also argued that when we talk about bilateral and multilateral negotiations in terms of economic diplomacy, it becomes more complicated as it is not just concerned with negotiations of commercial issues but also deals directly with the processes of strengthening the economy of a country. Moreover, she added that negotiations and decision making with regard to economic diplomacy need more deliberation as it holds more complexities than other forms of diplomacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe speakers highlighted that a distinct feature of economic diplomacy is that along with the foreign ministry, home based ministries like finance, trade, and environment are a part of the decision making process and also lead negotiations. Therefore, government agencies require better coordination and clarity in authority to properly execute their roles. She also added that issues such as the politicization of foreign policy agendas and loose diplomatic practices have weakened Nepal’s position and negotiation in the past. Therefore, there needs to be more domestic clarity as economic diplomacy depends on domestic realities.</p>', NULL, 2883, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670741704_BiratAnupam_Itahari_RSS_21_IMG-20210305-WA00921-2048x1533.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-03', '2020-03-05', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 18:40:04', '2022-12-11 18:40:04'),

Neither the government nor the major political parties have seriously worked towards for that. Political observers blame leaders for failing to prioritize the transitional justice process despite reiterated written and verbal commitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 21 November 2oo6, Nepal Government and the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA)[1] and ended the 10-year-long insurgency. The international community warmly welcomed the peaceful transformation of Nepal into a new era, giving new hopes to the victims of the decade-long war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNCHR), on 8 October 2012, released a comprehensive report with a database of around 30,000 documents archiving record of 9,000 serious cases of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.[2] Most of the victims of the insurgency had hoped that they will finally be ensured justice. Constitutional Provision</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Interim Constitution 2007, Article 33 (Dha), Article 132 (1), (2), and (3) and Constitution of Nepal, 2015, Article 249 clause (2)(e) and (h) foresaw establishment of the transitional justice to take action against cases of human rights violation during the decade-long armed conflict. The high-level truth and reconciliation commission would investigate cases of gross violations of human rights violence during the war.[3] The CPA 2006, Article 8.4 had also provisioned forming commission for transitional justice. The CPA considered upholding of human rights with separate provisions on rights and made references to international human rights instruments like Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, International Humanitarian Law, and fundamental principles and values.[4] Likewise, CPA, Article 5.2.3 states “both sides agree to make public within 60 days of the signing of the agreement the real name, caste, and address of the people made ‘disappeared’ or killed during the conflict and inform the family members about it.[5] But justice has been a far cry for the families of the victims or any sort of action against the perpetrators have not been taken until now. Transitional Justice Situation Update</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The erstwhile government and Maoist rebels agreed to ensure justice and reconciliation for the victims, and in June 2007, the process of transitional justice began.[6] Eight years later, on February 2015, the government established two justice bodies – Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and Commission on Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP). As of July 2017, the TRC has received 58,052 complaints of human rights violations, and the CIEDP has received 2874 complaints of alleged enforced disappearances.[7] The four-year tenure and extended two years more for the commission period failed to give justice to the victims. The commission spent time collecting complaints. Currently, TJ bodies have remained without leadership since 14 April 2019,[8] and the government has failed to appoint new leadership on various pretexts. The federal parliament endorsed an amendment bill on the CIEDP and TRC Act 2014.[9] Parties picked up former attorney general Raman Shrestha as chief of TRC, but Shrestha was not ready to take the responsibility.[10]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the commissions have failed in working towards its aims and objectives and have not addressed the voice of the victims. Thousands of war victims are still in search of justice.[11]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s transitional justice process awaits a logical end. Neither the government nor the major political parties have seriously worked towards for that. Political observers blame leaders for failing to prioritize the transitional justice process despite reiterated written and verbal commitments.[12] Due to a lack of confidentiality and meaningful investigation, the conflict victims groups have never trusted the TJ bodies’ work and its investigation. After CPA was signed, Nepali political parties reintegrated the Maoist combatants into the Nepal Army in July 2013 and Nepal framed a new constitution. However, the Federal Democratic Republic is yet to heal the wounds of the victims. International Community Concerns</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International Community has been exerting pressure and expressing concerns Nepal’s transitional justice process. The government and major parties have all time lacked the political will and meaningful consultations for resolving the issue. Many times different human rights activists group have exerted pressure and expressed concerns transitional justice. Five UN special rapporteurs on April 17, on July 29, four international organization have asked adopting a consultative and transparent appointment process.[13] The government had every time failed to provide justice. Likewise, Nepal’s human rights watchdog, the National Human Rights Commission, and the victims’ groups have demanded justice and appointment of leadership would be fair and clean. The Conflict Victims’ Common Platform is mostly articulate to raise the voice of the victims for justice. However, the government’s apathy towards the issue remains unchanged. Transitional Justice Lessons for Nepal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gambia Transitional Justice is more meaningful and reconciliable than Nepal’s TJ process. The Gambia had also faced blatant human rights abuses between 1994 to 2017 during Yayha Abdul-Aziz Jammeh’s rule. In December 2017, President Adama Barrow committed to forming the TJ bodies – Truth, Reconciliation, and Reparations Commission (TRRC), and the Constitutional Review Council (CRC).[14] Both commissions didn’t have any political interest and delivered justice without controversy. According to the Afrobarometer survey 2018, 46% of Gambian people have trust in both the commissions.[15] Similarly, Colombia has also resolved its long-running insurgency and ensured transitional justice.[16] Further, Sri Lanka has worked on its TJ process. Post-2015, the Government of Sri Lanka has been comparatively progressive about its commitment to transitional justice and human rights at the international level.[17] Way Forward</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking lessons from elsewhere, Nepal should establish itself as a land of peace and justice in the world arena. TJ process is to address the past judicial and non-judicial human rights violations and crimes. Nepal’s TJ bodies should, without any delays, give justice and allow for reconciliation. Fourteen years have already passed since 2006 CPA, and there should not be any further delays. The justice bodies should bring the perpetrators on the justice table if need be. Justice and reconciliation should be healing the wounds of the victims for sustainable peace and prosperity.

According to the Public Debt Management Office, as of April 2022, Nepal’s total outstanding debt stood at NPR 1.86 trillion, 53% of which (NPR 0.976 trillion) is external and the rest (NPR 0.884 trillion) is internal. National debt most notably has seen a significant increase in the recent years; outstanding debt was less than half of today’s amount in 2017/18 (NPR 0.917 trillion). Given the country’s reliance on foreign sources for financing, and amid public discourse about large development projects such as BRI, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Nijgadh Airport, Buddha Airport, etc., understanding how bureaucratic and political incompetency can hinder our ability to utilise foreign funds for economic prosperity is highly relevant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven this context, Centre for Social Inclusion and Federalism (CESIF) organised a seminar on the 17th of June on the theme, “Infrastructure Financing in Nepal” at the organisation’s premises in Kumaripati, Lalitpur. The speakers for the event were Lal Shankar Ghimire, former Secretary of Finance for Nepal, and Saumitra Neupane, Executive Director of Policy Entrepreneurs Incorporative. About 40 people attended the seminar including journalists, scholars, and experts from various fields.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmbassador Vijay Kant Karna, CESIF’s Executive Chairperson, commenced the seminar with a brief background on the topic, followed by an introduction to the objective of the session: to discuss the status of infrastructure funding pattern in Nepal, the current status of dependence regarding infrastructure funding, the current gap between funding for development need and domestic revenue sources, current level of national debt and debt servicing, and the potentiality of debt trap. The two speakers each gave their presentations on the issue, followed by a question-and-answer session at the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Significance of Infrastructure for Nepal and Its Current Status of Financing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of infrastructure financing for Nepal stems from the importance of infrastructure itself. Both the speakers, Mr Ghimire and Mr Neupane discussed the importance of infrastructure development for Nepal, a country that consistently targets above-6% economic growth rates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Neupane shared that while Nepal took a big leap in development of big infrastructure in the 1950s, our goal of becoming a middle income country requires a leap almost 3 times greater. For this, we need development in every sector. Apart from promoting productivity and the manufacturing sector, investments in infrastructure like connectivity, transportation, network, and markets are crucial for eased flow of goods and services. He stressed the importance of infrastructure for an efficient transformation of the economy, which marks the importance of infrastructure financing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Lal Shankar Ghimire mentioned that the primary financier of infrastructure in Nepal is the government whereas private investments account for a comparatively smaller share. As enlisted in the federal budget, the various sources of financing for the government include revenue, foreign grants, domestic borrowing, and foreign borrowing. Private financing on the other hand occurs through foreign direct investors and domestic investors. Mr Ghimire noted that since the 1990s, government revenue has been on a decreasing trend. Foreign grants, likewise, have also been declining. As such, the significance of borrowing (especially foreign borrowing) has grown steadily.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gap in infrastructure financing and lack of related studies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is intuitively understood that there is a gap between the resources required for infrastructure development and its availability in Nepal, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on this issue, and this was a topic of discussion as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Neupane explained that the government invests borrowed money whereas the private sector has limited engagement in infrastructure other than hydropower projects. Mr Ghimire also noted the absence of government-led or private research work in this field.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ghimire was able to provide some data on the financing gap based on international studies. A 2019 study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reported a funding gap of USD 7721 billion in the South Asian region. Likewise, another 2017 Asia-wide study estimated an annual deficit of 1.5 trillion whereas the World Bank estimated a gap of 10-15% of the country’s GDP. A study conducted by Confederation of Nepali Industries (CNI) and Institute of Integrated Development Studies (IIDS) that relates financing gap to growth rate estimated that to achieve a growth rate of 10%, Nepal requires additional USD 9 billion annually. Given that the government usually targets an economic growth rate of around 6-7%, it is evident that the financing gap in Nepal is huge, and in the billions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Current status of public debt and vulnerability to foreign exchange loss</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Neupane provided some data to portray Nepal’s current status of public debt. From the reference period of 2013/14 to current 2021, public debt has increased from 553 billion (28.51% of GDP) to 1737 billion (40.72% of GDP) .The share of foreign debt is about 60%. Of the foreign debt, 90% is from multinational organisations like ADB and World Bank. Regarding the bilateral loans, Japan has been the highest financier (4-5% of total foreign debt) followed by China and India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs around 90% of the country’s debt liabilities is in USD, Nepal is vulnerable to foreign exchange loss. Mr Ghimire asserted that since infrastructure projects are long-term, the steady depreciation of the Nepali Rupee with respect to the US Dollar results in additional costs that more than offset the concessional borrowing rates. He gave an example of Melamchi Drinking water project. Between 2002, when the project was undertaken, and 2022, the exchange rate of NPR with USD has increased from 73 to 125. This loss offsets any concessions provided by the lender.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The need for thorough verification of contracts when acquiring loans</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The nature of conditionalities on foreign loans and grants, and their suitability to Nepal’s requirements was a fundamental topic of discussion for the session.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ghimire argued that concessional loans, although attractive due to their low interest rates, need to be thoroughly assessed. Both speakers noted that projects funded by external lenders often include conditions that allow them to hire the contractor of their choice or that requires using their resources and labour. Mr Ghimire remarked this has hindered Nepal’s opportunity to use its national resources and foster productivity growth. It was however Mr Neupane’s assertion that diplomacy and infrastructure financing are inseparable. Conditions are a part of the trade-off that occurs when we undertake concessional loans, and Nepal should be able to harness diplomatic efforts to denefit the most out of such contracts. He gave an example how projects built on Indian or Chinese loans require using resources, both human and capital, to be imported from the lending country. Pokhara International Airport, built under Chinese loans, with an interest rate of 2% and repayment period of 13 years, is not profitable for Nepal. Likewise, Sindhuli Highway project, built under Japanese loans, was one of the most expensive projects for both parties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Ghimire additionally raised the issue of Engineering, Procuring, and Commision (EPC) contracts modality that most infrastructure projects based on foreign loans follow. He insisted that due to lack of proper verification, the terms and conditions, and use of resources end up being inappropriate and costly for us. He strongly condemned Nepal’s practice of overlooking feasibility reports, insisting on a thorough and earnest verification.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Uncertainty of Debt Trap Vulnerability</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The current debt-to-GDP ratio for Nepal stands at around 37%. However, there is no standard measure or threshold to compare the figure to, and there has been no consensus regarding what the appropriate amount of national debt should be. As a rule of thumb, the standard practice is to ensure that the rate of return exceeds the costs of borrowing (cost of capital). Mr Ghimire remarked that while a debt trap is not imminent for Nepal, the current practice of investing borrowed money without an assessment of the returns makes the country vulnerable in the long run.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr Neupane argued that vulnerability to debt trap should not be assessed based on mere numbers, but whether borrowed money is invested on projects with high rate of returns should be assessed<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe summarised his views on Nepal’s vulnerability to a debt trap by posing the following question: Given that Nepal acquires the funds required to finance infrastructure and ensures its optimal usage, is it guaranteed that Nepal can achieve its development goals? His answer was no. He believed that infrastructure financing is a part of a bigger development strategy.</p>', NULL, 2895, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670742365_Infrastructure-Financing-in-Nepal.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-06', '2022-06-23', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 18:51:05', '2022-12-11 18:51:05'),

The banks and financial institutions (BFIs), which raised the interest rate on deposits in early October, have also increased the interest rate on loans due to rising costs. The base rate of BFIs has climbed, even though they haven’t raised the interest rate on outstanding loans since last July.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterest-sensitive firms have been impacted by the commercial bank’s move to increase interest rates because the cost of borrowing has increased. Manufacturers’ fears have grown as a result of the rising interest rate. Despite the continued liquidity crisis, high-interest rates promote saving and lure deposits, yet many business lines with monthly repricing are struggling. Higher inflation and high-interest rates affect small enterprises’ cash flow, borrowing, and reinvestment capacity. Due to soaring fuel prices, rising raw material prices, and rising shipping costs, domestic producers—primarily exporters—were already confronted with difficult circumstances. As hiring slows down, high-interest rates even influence employment. It drives up the cost of production, weakens the sector’s ability to compete, and eventually encourages more imports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government prioritized domestic production in this year’s budget statement; however, this does not appear valid given the recent activity observed in Nepal’s banking sector. The interest rate must not be less than the inflation rate. If the interest rate is less than the inflation rate, there is a potential that money will go into informal lending. More investments will be directed towards unproductive sectors like housing and real estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">NOC’s stance to keep fuel prices high</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) has chosen to keep fuel prices high and unchanged despite the decline in oil prices on the global market. According to the state-owned company, it owes Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) around 33.60 billion rupees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNOC is making a Rs 14.56 profit on the sale of a liter of petrol in accordance with the new rates the company obtained on October 16, 2022. Petroleum product sales will generate Rs 390 million in earnings for the company over the course of 15 days. In contrast to making a profit on petrol and aviation fuel sales, NOC is at a loss on the sale of diesel and LPG. Despite the decreased cost price of petroleum from IOC, NOC is reluctant to revise the petroleum prices owing to its high cumulative loss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPublic outrage over the fact that domestic prices have not decreased in line with declining global pricing over the past two months is growing.

According to a Cabinet decision, the temporary ban on mobile phones costing more than $300, alcoholic beverages, automobiles, and motorcycles with engines larger than 150cc would last until December 15. The gross foreign exchange reserves decreased 2.0 percent to 9.35 billion in mid-September 2022 from 9.54 billion in mid-July 2022.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn August 30, the government lifted import restrictions from a few “luxury” products; these items included tobacco, large televisions, toys, playing cards, and diamonds, however, it maintained the ban on importing vehicles, motorcycles, cell phones, and alcohol.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the government’s continued restrictions on imports and restricted liquidity in the banking sector, the Dashain shopping season came to a tepid conclusion with fewer options for holiday shoppers. The ban on mobile phones, cars, heavy motorcycles, and alcoholic beverages made festival sales sluggish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCustoms revenue fell as a result of the government banning some imports to boost foreign exchange reserves.

Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh, formally requested India to import power from Nepal during her state visit in early September. In August, Nepal and Bangladesh came to an understanding that the Nepal Electricity Authority and Bangladesh Power Development Board would submit a request for a trilateral power trade agreement to NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) of India in order to permit the export of 40 to 50 megawatts of power produced in Nepal to Bangladesh. By 2040, Bangladesh plans to purchase 9,000 megawatts of electricity in total. Bangladesh has committed to buy 500 megawatts of electricity from the Upper Karnali Hydropower Project that the Indian firm Grandhi Mallikarjuna Rao (GMR) will construct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince India is located between Nepal and Bangladesh, and the two nations do not share borders, India’s participation will be essential to facilitate the exchange of electricity between them. In addition, Bangladesh has consented to the cooperative development of the 383MW Sunkoshi-3 Hydropower Project. The Baharampur-Bheramara cross-border transmission line, which connects Bangladesh and India, will be used by the nations to exchange power. If this trade agreement is signed, it would open a leeway for third-country electricity trade beyond India.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Milan Acharya', '/uploads/banner_image/1670742834_NOC-tankers-to-china.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-10', '2022-11-10', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 18:58:54', '2023-01-05 15:47:29'),

Before that, since March 2020 the checkpoints hadn’t been on smooth operations, with occasionally few trucks allowed to drop goods on side of the border. China has allowed the consignments to enter Nepal from Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi border points. This comes after the strong reservations from Nepali officials with Li Zhanshu, Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China, during his recent visit to Nepal. This is also attributed to the decreasing COVID-19 incidences in Tibet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust before the start of festive seasons in Nepal, the reopening of the border in the northern point might ease the hampering businesses which were dependent on imports from China.

According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 550,000 tons of paddy, 520,000 tons of rice, and 50,000 tons of broken rice in the last fiscal year, mostly from India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis year’s rice yield in Nepal is expected to be lower than in previous years due to various reasons; the government’s failure to provide farmers with chemical fertilizers during the paddy transplantation period in June, and the impact of drought-like environments on major food-producing districts, especially in the Terai Region. This decision by the Indian Government will make rice more expensive to Nepali consumers and might create a shortage of rice during the festive season when the demand for rice is generally high.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">A rise in bank interest rates</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Banks and Financial Institutions (BFIs) have raised their interest rates on fixed deposits by 10% to 12.13% just as the economy is commencing to recuperate from the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. The monetary policy for the past two fiscal years was expansionary as it was concerned with reviving the economy after the COVID-19 outbreak. At present, for the monetary policy of the FY 2022/23, NRB has taken a contractionary step to control the rising inflation rate which triggered the rate of interest on fixed deposits to rise. The interest rate on credits is projected to surpass 15% starting from October due to the revision of their base rate. Although Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) had been pressurizing the BFIs to increase their interest rate through monetary policy, the rate had been static for the months up to August.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn light of the continued liquidity problem, the central bank had also been recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to raise interest rates for banks. However, BFIs in Nepal has been facing all-around reproval from various sources after they decided to raise the interest rate. BFIs have been facing a liquidity crisis and facing problems to facilitate borrowers with loans. With the hope to ease the progressing liquidity crisis by drawing in more deposits, BFIs moved forward to increase their interest rate. Lately, the rising cost of necessary goods is particularly harsh on the common citizens. People’s day-to-day costs becoming even more expensive as a result of the higher interest rates.

However, according to “Procedure for Approval and Facilitating Import/Export of Electricity by Designated Authority-2021”, India can’t buy electricity from countries that have a foreign investment in the production and transmission of electricity.

While import of electricity has historically exceeded export, the trade deficit has been showing improvement in recent years. As the country’s hydropower potential grows with foreign, private-sector, and government investment, NEA claims that the sector will be able to generate a trade surplus in the coming years. As such, the prospect of relieving Nepal’s trade deficit and foreign exchange reserve vulnerability through the expansion of the country’s hydroelectricity sector and subsequent import-substitution and export-promotion has materialized.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a country that is entirely dependent on imports for the supply of petroleum products (its largest imports), Nepali economy remains vulnerable to the international market. Owing to international shortages and global inflation, the value of petroleum products imported by Nepal increased by over 90% in 2021/22 compared to 2020/21. This propelled further inflation in the country. By encouraging use of electricity in cooking and transportation through the promotion of electric cookers and electric vehicles respectively, Nepal can reduce its reliance on petroleum products. Further, the expansion of hydropower production can benefit the country through export- promotion. In this regard, South Asia has emerged as a viable region for cross-border energy trade, in particular there is increased interest from Bangladesh and India to import from Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">India’s growing involvement in the electricity sector</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The West Seti and Seti River hydropower projects have been in the works since over 50 years ago, having been passed on from one developer to another without completion. The most recent undertaking of the project was by a Chinese hydropower developer, before it was scrapped in 2018 when the Chinese company opted out citing financial unfeasibility. With the Indian investment, the Seti hydropower projects can produce electricity throughout the year and they are aimed to be used to supply electricity to India and Bangladesh. However, since the project has been rejected and unfinished by many developers due to difficulties with profitability and rehabilitation costs, it is unclear if the Indian venture will finish it. Increased investment in hydropower projects, along with NEA’s participation in the Indian Energy Exchange market and talks of government-to- government electricity deal, shows that India can be a strong energy trade partner for Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Signs of economic recovery</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Table 1 presents some of the major macroeconomic indicators included in the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Indicator</th>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">2021/22</th>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">2020/21</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>GDP at constant prices (in Rs.)</td>\r\n			<td>2.52 trillion</td>\r\n			<td>2.38 trillion</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>GDP per capita at constant prices (in Rs.)</td>\r\n			<td>85,505</td>\r\n			<td>81,573</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>GDP per capita at constant prices (growth rate)</td>\r\n			<td>4.80%2</td>\r\n			<td>3.20%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>GDP per capita (in USD)</td>\r\n			<td>1372</td>\r\n			<td>1239</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>CPI (Inflation)</td>\r\n			<td>6.32%</td>\r\n			<td>3.60%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Trade deficit (in Rs.)</td>\r\n			<td>1.92 trillion</td>\r\n			<td>1.40 trillion</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Workers’ remittance (in Rs.)</td>\r\n			<td>1.00 trillion</td>\r\n			<td>0.96 trillion</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the report, a GDP growth rate of 4.8% was observed, an improvement from the previous year’s growth rate of 3.2%. Inflation, however, was almost twice the previous year’s value. While June recorded the highest inflation (year-on-year) with a rate of 8.56%, it stood at 8.08% in July, the final month of the fiscal year, and the annual average stood at 6.32%. The largest inflation was seen in the prices of ghee and oil (26%) followed by transportation (15%).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the external sector, Nepal’s annual trade balance was at a deficit of Rs. 1.92 trillion. The foreign exchange reserve shrunk by Rs. 255 billion this fiscal year, despite the last few months adding to the reserve. The decline in foreign exchange reserve is attributable to the global supply disruptions and international rise in prices induced by COVID and the conflict in Ukraine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNRB’s report shows that there are signs of recovery in regards to the foreign exchange reserve crunch. The number of new registrations for migrant workers increased by 392% while renewed entry increased by 199%; we can thus expect increased remittance income in the future. Remittance income exceeded Rs. 1 trillion, but compared to the previous year, the amount is only a 2.2% increase. Likewise, with fuel prices lowering internationally, and supply chains getting recovering, we can expect that the economy will be eased in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Obstacles to trade</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 2015 earthquake, trade with China through the Northern border points has seen frequent disruptions. While export through Tatopani and Rasuwagadhi, the two operational border points, has been completely zero for over 2 years, imports too have been minimal. In the fiscal year 2021/22, total exports to China declined by 20.4%. Due to the closure at both border points, goods headed towards Nepal targeting the festive season have been stranded, and it is unclear if the border will reopen before the festive season. Apart from hampering businesses and transporters operating at the Norther border, this also propels inflation and shortages which affects consumers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, the embargo introduced by Nepal government on its imports of non-essential goods is also an obstruction to the supply of goods in the country. The import restrictions imposed to curtail shrinking foreign exchange reserve was extended up to August 30 citing lack of improvements in the reserve. As improvements were seen in the reserve, the restrictions from some goods were lifted, but import of automobiles, mobile phones, and liquor is still heavily restricted. During Dashain and Tihar, Nepal typically observes increased consumer demand. This year however, the various trade or import obstacles is set to induce a shortage and propel a higher inflation.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Aayushma Manandhar', '/uploads/banner_image/1670747265_KaligandakiA_20200221175315.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-08', '2022-10-20', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 20:12:45', '2022-12-11 22:38:01');

Credit expansion and loosened requirements for banks, coupled with a post-pandemic economic boom, contributed to increased imports and a liquidity crunch in the banking sector. The new monetary policy, in line with what is being observed globally, is contractionary and aims to reel in the economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main feature of the monetary policy is the contracted money supply growth and credit expansion. Credit expansion and money supply growth targets have been reduced to 12% and 12.6% respectively, from the previous figures of 18% and 19%. Since most of the credit expansion has been used to finance imports, this policy measure will reduce domestic demand, demand for imports, and thus relieve the trade deficit and forex reserve crunch. Likewise, policy interest rates have been raised by 1.5% each. Bank rate (the cost of borrowing from the central bank) and deposit rate (the rate of return on deposits) for instance have been increased to 8.5% and 5.5% respectively. This will push domestic banks to also raise interest rates, thus incentivizing reduced public spending and borrowing. The policy also features tighter liquidity requirements. Cash Reserve Ratio (the percentage of banks’ deposit required to be kept in the central bank in cash) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (the percentage of deposits banks must maintain in liquid form) have been increased from 3% to 4% and 10% to 12% respectively. The policy has directed credit flow to the productive sector by allowing for distinguished interest rates for productive and non-productive sectors to ensure that despite limited credit expansion, economic growth is encouraged.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe proposed contractionary policy is appropriate at a time when the country is facing macroeconomic pressures such as inflation, growing trade deficit, and depleting forex reserves. While the monetary policy suggests a prompt rise in interest rates, the problem of liquidity crunch does not show an immediate sign of resolve. The proposed expansionary fiscal budget for 2022/23 also poses a challenge to the monetary policy, and the growth target of 8% is unlikely to be met.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Loss in Agricultural Production</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Agriculture reported that by mid-July, just 54% of the country’s arable land had been cultivated for plantation, a 22% reduction from last year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgricultural production accounts for a quarter of Nepal’s GDP, but due to inadequate development in irrigation, the sector’s reliance on rainfall is evident each year. Although the monsoon began early this year, plantation was obstructed due to irregularity, especially in the Terai region. Reduced plantation is principally worrisome in Madhes province, where only 39% of paddy plantation was complete. While reduced plantation will certainly result in low production, even the land that is cultivated faces a shortage of chemical fertilizers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith state-owned enterprises, Agriculture Input Company (AIC) and Salt Trading Corporation (STC) authorized to provide imported chemical fertilizers at subsidized prices to farmers, fertilizer shortages are perennial in Nepal. But global shortages and rise in prices has exacerbated the problem this year – fertilizer prices soared after the conflict in Ukraine and consequent sanctions on Russia disrupted supply. In February this year, Nepal signed a government-to-government deal with India, bypassing a long global tendering process. Accordingly, fertilizers were supposed to arrive in mid-July as crisis-mitigation but due to legal and institutional hurdles, the arrival remains uncertain. Further, despite the fiscal budget having increased the amount of money allocated for fertilizer subsidy from Rs. 12 to 15 billion, the sharp rise in prices renders this increase insufficient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a conjunction of reduced plantation and reduced productivity, agricultural production this year will doubtlessly be low. Apart from lowering the GDP, this is conducive to the country’s worsening trade balance in agriculture products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">External Sector</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>NRB’s macroeconomic report for June reveals a year-on-year inflation of 8.56%, a 70-month high. As a country that imports most essential and intermediate goods, with the largest import being petroleum products, Nepal’s inflation is primarily driven by external factors. On top of international rise in prices, the exchange rate of NPR with respect to USD has been on a steady increase, and it exceeded Rs. 128/USD this month. With imports becoming more expensive, the trade deficit increased by 25% in June compared to the previous month. While the foreign exchange reserve showed a growth, it still remains under pressure. Citing a lack of improvement in the reserve, the government announced to extend its 81-day ban of imports up to August 30.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegardless, with the post-COVID resurgence of economic activity, there are signs of recovery. Remittance, for instance, is on an increasing trend – the number of migrant workers going abroad increased by over 400% in the eleven months of this year compared to last year whereas the number of renewed entries increased by over 200%. Likewise, the number of tourist arrivals has also increased, with 50,000 arrivals in June. Foreign direct investment commitments soared by up 68% year-on-year to Rs. 54.5 billion according to the Department of Industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Electricity export to India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>India had allowed NEA to sell 364 MW of energy in its energy exchange market in April 2021. With surplus electricity generated during monsoon, Nepal has been exporting hydroelectricity to India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exported energy consists of surplus generated from Trishuli and Devighat Hydropower Projects, Kaligandaki Hydropower Project, Middle Marshyangdi, Marshyangdi, and Likhu-4, the first privately run plant to export hydroelectricity in South Asia. NEA reported a net earning of Rs. 1.72 billion in June by exporting 178.19 million units of electricity51. Meanwhile, NEA’s strategy to export electricity under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to India from July to November has been effectively scrapped. While the agreement would diversify risks for Nepali energy export, legal hurdles coupled by uncompetitive prices meant that trade through the Indian exchange is more beneficial. Thus, the possibility of export-promotion and import- substitution through a strong energy sector has emerged. However, since most hydropower projects in Nepal are run-of-the-river type, investments in reservoir-type projects are necessary to relieve trade-deficit problems in the long-run.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal Oil Corporation and its Growing Debt</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Having been granted a loan of Rs. 7 billion from the government and Rs. 3 billion from Rastriya Banijya Bank, Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) announced to pay Rs. 17 billion of its outstanding debt of Rs. 30 billion to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), and to not lower fuel prices until the debt is cleared.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith incessant rise in international fuel prices, NOC’s debt to its supplier, IOC, had been piling up despite periodic repayments. Its outstanding debt increased to over Rs. 30 billion in early July. Since the government levies taxes on petroleum products under various headings that amount to almost 50% of NOC’s buying price, the state-owned corporation had been calling for a reduction in taxes to relieve it from heavy losses and to curtail inflation in the country. Although the government announced a reduction in taxes, due to lack of coordination between the Ministry of Supplies and the Finance Ministry, the modalities of tax reduction are unclear. Moreover, with the extended import ban and policy targets to reduce imports, the importance of fuel taxes as a source of government revenue is paramount. As such, the perpetuity of tax reduction is unlikely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout tax reductions, NOC continues to incur heavy losses. Since the state-owned corporation plays the role of ensuring the supply of petroleum products in the country, its vulnerability to bankruptcy puts the entire country’s economy at risk. Moreover, the rise of fuel prices in the international market is expected to slow down because of worries for global recession. As such, NOC will be able to clear its debt soon, and fuel prices are likely to come down.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Aayushma Manandhar', '/uploads/banner_image/1670747779_Janardan-Sharma-House-of-Representatives.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-07', '2022-10-17', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 20:21:19', '2022-12-11 22:38:10'),

Provisions like reduction of the minimum threshold for foreign direct investment (FDI) from Rs. 50 million to Rs. 20 million will ease injection of foreign currency by attracting foreign investors. Many ambitious targets however are questionable; the aim to boost agriculture production by 30% for instance inadequately addresses the pressing issue of chemical fertilisers shortages in the international market since the allocated sum for fertiliser subsidies has only been increased by 25%. Likewise, the decision to set up a Rs. 500 billion microfinance fund for agriculture investment comes without any coordination with the Central Bank. Many aspects of the budget are contradictory as well. For example, the aim of reducing imports by 20% contradicts the 22% increase in revenue collection target since around half of our revenue is generated from customs and duties. Proposed distributive policies such as reducing the age-limit for old age allowance from 70 to 68 and increasing the salary of government workers by 15%, adds on to government liability and will propel inflation, making the budget populist rather than targeted to relieve macroeconomic difficulties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo add to this, the Finance Minister was accused of involving unauthorised personnel in adjusting tax rates; lack of further investigation about the issue has further raised questions about the budget’s legibility. Fiscal policies, understandably, have always been driven by political motives and it is likely that the trend of proposing a bloated budget and then revising it to make it smaller time and again is likely to occur again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Fluctuating oil prices and inflation</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the country has shown a steep increase since the conflict in Ukraine in February. The year-on-year inflation too increased from 7.28 in April to 7.86 in May.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNRB’s monthly report for May showed the highest increases in price of pulses and legumes (11%), ghee and oil (24%), transportation (22%), and education (12%). Paralleling the 7.87% increase in CPI, the SWRI (Salary and Wage Rate Index) has gone up by 8.52%, with private institution workers (4.2%) and construction labourers (5.3%) having the lowest increase in income. Day-to-day wage earners in the informal sector are expected to be hit the hardest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsequently, the public outcry when NOC increased prices by a record of Rs. 20 was expected. While the increase in the rise in petroleum prices is reflective of the increase in price quoted by the Indian Oil Corporation, the composition of the price is worth discussing. Of the Rs. 199, NEA bought petrol at Rs. 131.91 per litre from IOC and paid a total of Rs. 65.61 as various taxes. Accounting for operating, maintenance, and transport costs, NEA bears a loss of Rs. 13.58 per litre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn June 24, the government announced a reduction of taxes, bringing down the price of petrol to Rs. 179. While this decision was welcomed by the general public, it brings a significant dent to government revenue and reduces the price margin between India and Nepal, which can encourage smuggling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">External sector (exchange rate, trade deficit, foreign exchange reserve)</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR depleted against the dollar to reach a record of 125.76 against the USD on June 22.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe depletion of NPR is simply a reflection of the depletion of INR since we have a pegged currency system, coupled with USA’s decision to increase interest rates to combat inflation, but its effect on Nepal’s external debt, trade deficit, foreign exchange reserve, and inflation is paramount. A low exchange rate is preferred for exporters and detested by importers. As an importing country with a large trade deficit, the depleting currency will propel inflation and worsen trade deficit. According to the ten-month data for the fiscal year, the foreign exchange depleted by USD 2411 million, to a gross total of USD 9.28 billion, which is enough to cover prospective merchandise and services import for a record low of 6.57 months. Likewise, the country’s foreign liabilities are also set to suffer from foreign exchange loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Export of electricity to the Indian Exchange Market</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>India had allowed NEA to sell 364 MW of energy in its energy exchange market in April 2021. With early monsoon and hydropower projects generating surplus energy, Nepal has sold all the allowed energy, being the first South Asian country to participate in the Indian exchange market, and the country’s private sector exporting energy for the first time. Thus, the possibility of export-promotion and import-substitution through a strong energy sector has emerged. However, since most hydropower projects in Nepal are run-of-the-river type, a considerable amount of electricity is imported in the dry seasons, and more investments are necessary to relieve trade-deficit problems in the long-run.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Stock market crisis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The bearish stock market this month is a culmination of many factors. Around this time last year, NEPSE experienced a massive surge, reaching its all-time high, which was primarily driven by the economic slowdown of COVID when people had little opportunity to spend and thus participated in stock-trading. With the post-pandemic boom of economic activity, the stock market’s decline was inevitable. But international economic meltdown has accelerated this decline. Given rising inflation in the country and BFIs increasing interest rates to maintain the 90% credit-deposit ratio, investors have little incentive to participate in trading. Likewise, the stock market in Nepal is considered fairly underdeveloped, and the Central Bank has always actively participated to regulate activity. For example, during the bull market last year, the bank issued a directive limiting marginal loans to Rs. 40 million from one BFI and Rs. 120 million in total. Banks are now issuing margin calls and investors, already at a loss, are having a difficult time paying back. The claim that the current bear market is due to NRB’s policies does not hold much basis, and it is more reasonable that it is driven by multiple factors.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Aayushma Manandhar', '/uploads/banner_image/1670748192_Janardan-Sharma-House-of-Representatives.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-06', '2022-07-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 20:28:12', '2022-12-12 16:42:43'),

Finance Minister Janardan Sharma presented a total budget of Nrs. 1.793 trillion and a growth target of 8 percent, both of which have been targeted under the assumption that the effects of the pandemic and existing economic troubles shall be dealt with within a few months. Nevertheless, the budget does have some positive aspects. The budget has prioritised increasing the human development index by 0.65 percent to accelerate the nation’s ambition of transitioning into a developing country. Similarly, the government has also emphasised the agriculture sector by allocating Nrs. 10 billion for the agriculture promotion program, handing over of agriculture zones over to the provinces, establishing a ‘farmers welfare fund’ as seed money to agricultural farmers and allocating an additional 50 million to the local governments for the transformation of traditional agricultural techniques to a more modern one. Likewise, development of physical infrastructure has also received its due importance. Adequate budget has been allocated for the construction of petroleum pipelines along the Amlekhgunj-Lothar (Chitwan) and Siliguri-Charaali (Jhapa), Bhairahawa and Simara special economic zones are to be brought into operation, Nrs. 3.79 billion has been allocated for industrial infrastructures, Nrs. 43.95 billion allocated for the construction of transmission lines and substations, Nrs. 6.53 billion allocated for rail and metro-rail projects, alongside ensuring that the budget allocated for national pride projects will not be transferred to projects other than the national pride projects. Moreover, the lowering of the minimum threshold for FDI injection from Nrs. 50 million to Nrs. 20 million has been well-welcomed. Furthermore, the focus on the health sector wherein Nrs. 100 million has been allocated for free kidney transplant programme for the underprivileged, Nrs. 1.5 billion as allowances for people living with chronic diseases such as cancer and kidney problems and Nrs. 7.5 billion for the health insurance programme has been well appreciated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conjunction with the positive aspects, there are areas where the budget has severely lacked. The government has failed to accommodate core issues revolving around poverty, inflation, employment creation, manufacturing and productivity among others. For instance, the government’s plan of increasing money supply into the financial markets contradicts its plan of taming the rising national inflation rate which according to the nine months data of the central bank (Nepal Rastra Bank) stands at 7.28 percent. Likewise, the lowering of the eligible age for elderly allowance from 70 to 68 and increment in salary of public officials by 15 percent is anticipated to heavily burden the national treasury which is already weak owing to high imports and depleting foreign exchange reserves. Similarly, while the Finance Minister announced cash schemes of up to 8 percent for products including clinker, cement, steel, footwear, processed water, ICT-based services, and services related to business process outsourcing; domestic products such as carpets and ready-made garments failed in receiving similar incentives/schemes. Moreover, the low allocation of Nrs. 380 billion towards capital expenditure as compared to the allocation of Nrs. 753.40 billion towards recurrent expenditure is anticipated to hamper physical and social infrastructure building with higher taxes and revenues mobilised towards making payment for ballooning recurrent expenses; ultimately leading the economy towards resource deficit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Rising petroleum prices, rising inflation</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) increased prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene by Nrs. 10 litre each on 14 May 2022.

However, despite the adjustment, NOC reported that it was operating under a loss of Nrs. 4.25 billion fort nightlies. Fast forward to 22 May 2022, NOC increased fuel prices once again for the second time in a span of eight days.

According to Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) monthly report – Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation of Nepal – the annual consumer inflation and BOP deficit has reached 7.28 percent and Nrs. 268.26 billion respectively during the first nine months of the current fiscal year (FY) 2021/22. Similarly, total foreign exchange reserve has reduced by 16.5 percent, reaching Nrs. 1,167.92 billion during the same review period. Considering this, the recent increase in petroleum prices comes at a time when end-consumers are already reeling under soaring price hikes of daily necessities and other consumable goods. Being an import-dependent nation, inflation is primarily driven by imports in Nepal. With the country importing more than what it exports; domestic prices have been on a spiral. According to NRB’s same report, the country imported merchandise imports of Nrs. 1466.66 billion as compared to merchandise exports of Nrs. 160.57 billion. Similarly, within the imports bill, import for petroleum fuel stands at 14.1 percent of total imports. Any increase in the prices of imported final goods directly impacts expenditure-based measures of inflation. In simpler words, excessive import increases imported inflation leading to increase in domestic costs of production and prices of domestically produced goods. This can be vividly seen in the Nepali economy today. With little incentive to produce domestically, the country’s over-reliance on imports is costing dearly to the general public, in particular pressuring the lower and middle-income households. Moreover, it has also shed light on the faulty policies that the nation has implemented in managing imports and exports. With imports becoming an easier method of catering to domestic needs, most manufacturing sectors have also been left with little incentive to produce goods that actively contribute towards the national gross domestic production (GDP); further exacerbating the overall national inflation rate.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670748205_Economy-1.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-05', '2022-07-07', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 20:28:25', '2022-12-11 22:38:25'),

The government had decided that the families of security personnel to be compensated Rs 2 million in case of death and to bear the treatment costs for injuries sustained during the deployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the elections were comparatively peaceful, some election commission officials have expressed dissatisfaction towards security agencies towards their preparedness. The officials also highlighted security lapses in several polling stations. The incident in Rautahat where the locals ran away with the ballot boxes from two different polling stations is a major security concern. However, the security officials have pointed out that lack of security personnel is the major cause of election mismanagement. Nepal Police has also refuted the claim that one of the reasons for security lapses is the hiring of inexperienced personnel for temporary police.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Flood Preparedness</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Nepal is expected to receive above average rainfall this year. A good monsoon is essential to boost the agricultural production and replenish the groundwater aquifers and reservoirs. The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology with the study from South Asian Seasonal Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF) had predicted above average rainfall last year too. Despite the early warnings, the government did not take necessary precautions which directly resulted in the death of many people and caused damage to infrastructures and affected people’s livelihood. Furthermore, the rain also severely damaged the paddy production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the main reasons for continued damage caused by rainfall is the government’s emphasis on distributing short term relief funds rather than coming up with long term disaster management plans. Likewise, previous years have indicated that there is a problem in dissemination of information regarding the weather. The department of hydrology and meteorology has already indicated the areas that might see above average rainfall this season. So, the government should identify potential risk factors in these areas and come up with a detailed plan to make the vulnerable communities resilient. Since farmers are one of the most vulnerable groups, the information regarding the weather must be shared timely so that they can make necessary preparations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Looming Food Security Issues</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although good rain during the monsoon is important for a good harvest of paddy, the issues regarding the availability of fertiliser haven’t been resolved yet. According to different sources, two major suppliers of fertilisers have nearly exhausted their resources. Hence, along with the possible impact of heavy rain, lack of availability of fertilisers can add to the existing woes of the farmers. Last year, post monsoon rain destroyed the ready to harvest paddy crops, and the damages in the crop losses was estimated at around 0.6% of the GDP. Despite being an agrarian country, destruction of agricultural products as a result of heavy rain and fertiliser crisis is a recurring theme every year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, wheat production is also projected to get hit this year due to the late plantation. The post monsoon rain delayed the paddy harvest which further delayed the wheat plantation. According to a report, wheat yield decreases by 1% each day of delayed sowing. Furthermore, India has imposed a ban on the export of wheat. According to the data of FY 20/21, it imported Rs 11.97 billion worth of wheat. Thus, low yield coupled with export ban imposed by India will have severe consequences to the food security of Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Supreme Court’s Decision regarding the Nijgadh Airport</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 26th, Supreme Court ordered the government to look for alternative site for the construction Nijgadh International Airport. Conservationists and Environmentalists had been protesting the decision to construct Nijgadh citing environmental degradation reasons. The decision of the supreme court was welcomed by the environmentalists, whereas it was criticised by the politicians and the locals of Bara.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment), the construction of the airport required cutting down 2.4 million trees. Similarly, the EIA report in itself was criticised for lacking the details regarding social and environmental impacts and mitigation plans to address these issues. On the other hand, various political leaders have claimed that the decision from Supreme Court as baseless and urged to review the decision. Around Rs 2 billion has already been spent on the airport so far for preparing the master plan and conducting detailed feasibility study. While the Supreme Court realises the need for a second international airport, it has emphasised on finding an alternative location which would entail minimal environmental damages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Monkeypox cases raise alarm</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The increasing cases of monkeypox outside of Africa has raised alarms around the world. Monkeypox. Monkeypox is transmitted to humans from animals like monkeys and rodents. Human to human transmission occurs through close contact with infected person’s body fluids, respiratory droplets, and blood. This disease is commonplace in west and central Africa, but recently the disease has spread in the non-endemic countries in North America and Europe. Since people frequently travel from these regions to Nepal, there is a potential risk of the spread of monkeypox virus. The government has urged the public to be extra careful and has suggested people travelling from foreign countries to quarantine. However, the officials at Tribhuvan International Airport have claimed that they haven’t received any instruction from the concerned authorities. Public health experts have urged that although the symptoms are mild, the risks associated with it shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>', NULL, 2811, NULL, NULL, 'Yunish Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670751326_National-Security.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-05', '2022-07-07', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 21:20:26', '2022-12-16 19:39:04');

This incident which has come to light after 8 years has shaken the whole nation to the core. Serious concerns have been raised on social media platforms about whether the rape case can be filed in court owing to the limitation imposed by law. The video which appeared across social media infuriated the public, with people coming to the streets to voice their overwhelming support to the victim. A solidarity protest took place near PM residence demanding the removal of the statute of limitations for rape and sexual violence and called for action against the guilty. The protest has drawn the attention of the Nepal police. However, in the absence of the official complaint from the victim, the police cannot investigate the case. Nonetheless, the Ministry of Home Affairs had directed Nepal Police to form a high-level team to initiate a probe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the present scenario, since the victim revealed the incident of rape after eight years, the statute of limitations prohibits the Nepal police from charging the accused of rape. However, under pressure after widespread protests and the House of Representative directive, police arrested Manoj Pandey- one of the key suspects into custody for investigation. He has been arrested under the Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2007 (2064) as there is no statute of limitation to register compliant of sexual and physical exploitation of a person under this Act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe prevalent culture of stigma, shame, intimidation, and trauma has long prevented women from speaking out and reporting cases of sexual harassment cases on time. In many such cases the victims do not want to go beyond naming and shaming the alleged offenders and lodge a formal complaint. Nonetheless, an official complaint is prerequisite for Nepal Police to start an investigation into sexual violence and rape. As per law, such a complaint must be filed within a year of the incident. If the claimant fails to bring the action before the court within a specified period of time, such claim can be “time-barred”. A statute of limitations is a law that sets the maximum amount of time that parties involved in a dispute have to initiate legal proceedings from the date of an alleged offence, whether civil or criminal. When the statute of limitation expires, the courts have no jurisdiction over the matter. The intention behind creating the statute of limitations is to resolve the case within a “reasonable period of time” so that the case does not go beyond a specific length. Additionally, statutes of limitations were enacted in part to prevent convictions based on “untrustworthy witness testimony,” such as memories of incidents that occurred years ago.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe intention behind creating the statute of limitation may seem justified as it aims to prevent the miscarriage of justice. However, in an offence of rape, period of limitation creates a legal barrier to access justice by the victim; taking into account the stigma that women and girls face when reporting cases of sexual crimes. Therefore, considering the socio-cultural factors, it is imperative to extend the statute of limitation provision so as to ensure effective access to justice for rape and end the culture of impunity. At the same time, the policy makers should also keep in mind the accused’s legal right to defend himself, while drafting the laws relating to limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Action to reform rape laws to ensure Justice</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Women and Social Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives has directed the government to immediately bring the necessary bill in the parliament to amend the existing laws to remove the statute of limitations to register rape cases. Minister of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs Govinda Bandi has directed the Nepal Law Commission to submit a study report and make recommendations on extending the statute of limitation in rape cases. Based on their recommendations, the ministry will begin the process of amending the law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to 2017, Nepal had 35-day statutory limitation for prosecutors to file a charge sheet for a rape. In the year 2017, government drafted the new penal code amending the existing Muluki Ain, which further increased six months of statute of limitation on rape cases. In the Muluki Criminal Code 2017 which came into effect in August 2018, the statute of limitations was increased to one year. According to legal experts, a year period is still among the shortest limitation periods in South Asia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this background it is pertinent to note that, in the year 2008, division bench of Supreme Court had issued a directive order in the name of the Government of Nepal stating that “there should not be any limitations for rape victims to file complaints and for the police to begin investigations since it is a crime against humanity.” Nepal authorities failed to comply with the Supreme Court directives. After 14 years of the judgement, the Ministry has finally come to an agreement to amend the provision of limitation. Whether the provision of limitation in rape cases will be removed or increased in the near future, remains to be seen. Having said that, the ongoing issue is also an indication that changes in official policy, leading to changes in laws and regulations, are more often than not motivated by public pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Gender- responsive budget for the new FY 2022-23</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the discussion on the Federal Budget for the new FY 2022/23, the lawmakers of the House of Representatives underlined the need to make collaborative efforts to achieve gender-responsive budgeting (GRB) in the upcoming budget, policy and programmes. The Women Committee of House of Representative has directed the National Women Commission and the Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizen to prioritise women related issues such as reconsideration of tariffs in the import of sanitary pads and silicon cups, to ensure the rights of sexually marginalised communities, reducing gender-based violence, minimising maternity and child mortality rate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the FY 2021/2022, the proportional share of the budget for the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizen was one of the lowest amongst the social sector allocations, with an expenditure of Rs. 9079 million. The share of federal budget was allocated to eliminate all form of sexual and gender-based violence including dowry system by undertaking awareness programs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the FY 2022/2023, a budget of Rs 1.77 billion has been allocated for the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens. Investments shall be made towards distribution of one electric stove (as a grant) to each family; development of Nepali sign language; sign language and braille textbooks to be available for free.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, a policy of positive discrimination has been incorporated in the budget for senior citizens, single women, differently-abled people, Dalits, indigenous groups and children below 5 years of age. Rs. 1.34 billion has been allocated for social security allowances for the benefit of the above mentioned categories. There has been a change in the age limit for availing the old age allowance. The old age allowance will now be allocated from the age of 68 years, previously it was 70. However, the contribution-based social protection fund launched by the government of Nepal is yet to attain the expected success. One of the reasons being the contradictory provision stipulated in schedule 9 of the Constitution of Nepal 2015 and the Social Security Act. Schedule 9 of the Constitution lists social protection as a common right of the federal, state, and local levels. On the other hand, the Social Security Act only clarifies the role of the local governments in the management of the distribution of security allowance. Critics argue that the federal government should be involved in the management of the allowance’s distribution to attain the desired goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere has also been change in tax related provisions wherein the customs duty on pads has been reduced by 90 percent. According to the finance minister, a significant discount has been made on the import duty on raw materials required for the sanitary pad manufacturing industry in Nepal. Additionally, the sanitary pads to be distributed as per the program approved by the government or public bodies should be purchased from indigenous products. In the FY 2021/2022, progressive investments were made towards menstrual hygiene and health. INR 4.79 billion was allocated free distribution of menstrual sanitary. In this background it is pertinent to note that, when Sher Badhur Deuba-led government approved a replacement bill to amend the annual Nepal budget plan 2021/22, the approval of the budget subsequently increased the price of sanitary pads in the market, which led to protest demanding tax rebate on sanitary pad.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1670751928_SBN_TANAHU-2.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-05', '2022-07-07', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 21:30:28', '2022-12-11 21:30:28'),

The statement also outlined that the purpose of her visit was to “deepen cooperation on human rights and democratic governance goals and to advance humanitarian priorities. However, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal said that the delegation arriving alongside Zeya would discuss projects being undertaken between Nepal and the US and other bilateral talks. Similarly, Tibetan leaders in Nepal divulged that they would be meeting with the Under Secretary a day prior to her arrival. However, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that the Nepali government was not aware of such meetings. The discrepancy between American statements and Nepal’s official positions appear odd.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe arrived in Kathmandu on May 20 for a three-day visit.

It was reported that Chinese officials expressed concerns regarding the visit of US Under Secretary Uzra Zeya to Tibetan camps in Kathmandu. During the 14th meeting of Nepal-China Bilateral Consultative Mechanism. According to officials present in the meeting, Nepal maintained its commitment to the One-China policy and not allowing its soil to be used for anti-Chinese activity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer visit came at a time where United States has been exerting pressure to provide identity cards to Tibetan refugees living in Nepal. Nepal has been treating the Tibetan issue with caution acknowledging that Tibet is China’s internal matter which makes the matter geopolitically sensitive issue. Therefore, the matter of issuing refugee cards to Tibetan refugees could result in major repercussions for Nepal and its bilateral ties with China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe flurry of high level foreign visits and engagements indicates that the ratification of the MCC compact has elevated bilateral relations between Nepal and the United States. In addition, Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is scheduled to visit Washington in mid-July. This is also a good opportunity for Nepal to capitalise on the United States’ increasing geopolitical interests and engagements towards fulfilment of Nepal’s national interests, pursuit of economic advancement and infrastructure development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal-India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his fifth visit to Nepal when he visited Lumbini on May 17, on the occasion of Buddha Jayanti at the invitation of UNESCO. New Delhi has recognized the need to better bilateral ties with Nepal, which in the recent past had soured. Prime Minister Modi arrived in Lumbini on a helicopter bypassing the Gautam Buddha International Airport that was inaugurated by his Nepali counterpart Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba earlier that morning. Various media reports said that this was a symbolic demonstration of India’s dissatisfaction with the presence of infrastructure built by a Chinese company in the Southern border of Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring his visit, Prime Minister Modi participated in the Buddha Purnima celebrations by visiting the Maya Devi temple where he offered water to a Bodhi tree sapling that he had gifted on his visit in 2014. He also visited the India International Centre for Buddhist Culture and Heritage where he laid the foundation stone. Prime Minister Modi’s comment corroborating Lumbini being the birthplace of Buddha also seemed to bring to a close the longstanding debacle in Nepal-India relations. Religious and cultural affiliation has long been a thread connecting Nepal and India with citizens on both sides travelling across the border for Hindu pilgrimage. Modi seems to have found another binding thread in the promotion of Buddhism to pursue soft diplomacy in Nepal. Prime Minister Modi highlighted that “Buddha is beyond geographical boundaries, he is for everyone, and he belongs to everyone“. The growing and strengthening friendship between India and Nepal will work for the benefit of the entire humanity amid the kind of global situation that is emerging today. Analysts have also remarked that “Prime Minister Modi’s visit should be seen in the context of India’s continued tradition of regular high level exchanges between India and Nepal in furtherance of our Neighbourhood First policy”.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and India signed six Memorandum of Understanding related to cooperation and collaboration in the academic field and energy sector during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Lumbini: Both leaders also recognised Lumbini in Nepal and Kushinagar in India as sister cities. Despite significant symbolic gestures from India indicating improving ties after a period of difficulty, major bilateral issues remain unaddressed. For instance, a joint statement released during Modi’s first visit to Nepal in 2014 outlined the resolution of Nepal’s request for three additional air passages for aircrafts to enter Nepal within the next six months. However, the issue remains unresolved. Moreover, the visit failed to address outstanding bilateral issues such as the border row at Kalapani which demonstrates a persistent problem of diplomatic non-communication over bilateral issues and lack of follow through on agreements between Nepal and India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that a day after Modi’s visit, Naveen Srivastava, currently serving as additional secretary in the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, was announced to become the next Indian Ambassador to Nepal. What makes his appointment noteable is due to his integral role in diplomatic and military dialogues with China to mitigate the tenison’s caused by military skirmishes at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). He has also served as consul general in Shanghai. he appointment of a China expert as India’s ambassador to Nepal also indicates that New Delhi has carefully noticed China’s increasing presence in Nepal and taken measures to downsize China’s growing influence in Nepal. Nepal has once again found itself amidst heightened geopolitical activity with increased engagement with both India and the United States. While such positive developments after a period of difficulty with both countries is desirable for Nepal, it must avoid mistakes of the past and respond in a way that it can capitalise off of great power interest. Nepal must avoid blindsiding China and tread with caution regarding issues of Tibetan refugees. This is an opportunity to formulate a synthesised, consistent and balanced foreign policy that best serves Nepal’s national interests and development goals.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670752432_IR-img-1.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-05', '2022-07-07', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 21:38:52', '2022-12-11 21:38:52'),

The political parties especially in the ruling coalition, are contesting the local elections under an electoral alliance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLately the electoral alliance has become the subject matter of controversy as alliance politics may cut down the women’s representation at the local level. When contesting elections under an alliance, each political party fields a candidate for just one of the two positions. Since it is an electoral alliance between two political parties, the respective parties agree to allocate the position for mayor and deputy mayor. Past events have indicated that political parties have no position to offer to women aspirants when an electoral alliance is formed. Consequently, women leaders miss the opportunity to represent themselves in the executive position. Such practice, arguably, contradicts the principle of inclusiveness, one of the cardinal principles of the Constitution of Nepal 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSection 17 (4) of the Local Level Election Act, 2017, requires one of the two candidates for chief or deputy chief at the local level to be a woman. Thus, it is mandatory that each political party’s chief and deputy chief nominations for local units to be gender-balanced. However, the provision is not applicable if the party fields a candidates for just one of two positions. This provision has provided a leeway to political parties not to abide by proportional inclusive provisions. Accordingly, the parties are not obliged to nominate male-female alternate seat provisions in the highest positions of Chief and Deputy Chief, Mayor and Deputy Mayor where two of one must be female.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Call for Ensuring Proportional Representation of Women in Local Election</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The current trends indicate that alliance politics may fail to ensure the representation of women and marginalized groups which could in turn reduced representation of women at the local level. Women leaders have urged both Prime Minister and Chief Election Commissioner to ensure that the parties contesting upcoming local elections as an alliance field women candidates in one of the two top positions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNHRC has urged the bodies concerned to amend acts and rules that contradict the proportional inclusive provisions of the Constitution. Whether this recommendation is acted upon or not remains to be seen owing to the fact that 25 April 2022 is the last day to file nomination for the May 13 local level election. In this background it is pertinent to note that an analysis of this issue may have been forecasted by NHRC. On 23 February, NHRC issued a press note stating that it will observe the local level election which may include activities like, legislative review, registration of candidates, women’s participation in elections, participation of persons from minority communities etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Election Commission of Nepal issued a 17- point directive dated 30 March, 2022, to the political parties, directing to field a woman if they contest in only one position. However, later on 20 April, after allegedly receiving pressure from the political parties, the commission revised clause 6 of the directive which now states; the parties “should give priority” to women while nominating candidates for the positions. The revised statement has been criticised by the Women leaders from various parties. Even though there have been instances where the constitutional bodies have urged or directed the political parties to respect the principle of inclusion, by far we cannot see strict adherence to it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Mohna Ansari on 19 April filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court demanding proportional representation of women right from the nominations process. The court on 25 April, 2022, was to decide whether or not to issue an interim order in response to the petition. On 27 March 2022, the court refrained from issuing an interim although it has issued a show cause notice against the government and the commission. The hearing was delayed by two days and by the time the hearing took place the candidacy filing process had already completed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCritics claim that the concerned authority took little initiative to ensure to women at least one of the two positions despite the issue being raised weeks before the start of nomination process. However, in all the aforementioned instances it is noteworthy that the issue was dealt with at the last minute: be it filing of writ petition, the decisions of judiciary or the directive of election commission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe constitutional obligation of favourable reservation is a policy tool that has increased women’s representation in politics particularly from marginalized groups. Notably, the road to substantial involvement in leadership and decision-making roles for women is fraught with difficulties. Woman are not given opportunity to compete for higher posts and are forced to settle for minor posts in the elections. Chances of a woman winning in top executive positions are also thin because major parties have fielded only male candidates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncrease in descriptive representation of minorities in the state apparatus may impact the level of substantive representation. However, this does not necessarily guarantee that their interests are protected. Though affirmative measures are used for addressing the representation gap, measures such as the quota system may continue to remain controversial. Quota may not have any meaningful effect on women or minorities to attain consequential leadership positions. The substantive representation of women requires not only the presence of woman representatives but requires commitment and action to uphold their position which the current system lacks. For instance, giving someone their rights is not enough; they also need a positive environment where they can assert their rights and generate results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Mayoral Candidate Accused of Sexual Misconduct</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When UML nominated Keshav Sthapit for the positions of mayor of Kathmandu for the upcoming local elections, public were infuriated that someone who has been accused of sexual harassment has been given a ticket to contest the polls. In this background it is pertinent to note that Sthapit was accused of sexual harassment in the wake of the #MeToo movement in Nepal in the year 2018. While denying the allegations levelled against him, he has claimed this to be a “rape of men’s rights”.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is unethical for a candidate accused of sexual harassment to be holder of a public office as his/her characteristic impacts voter choice, scandals are found to negatively impact a political campaign. Citizens are less likely to support a candidate accused of sexual harassment. An alternate view point is that, the candidates in response to the accusations, have accused women for making up the false narrative to undermine his credibility especially at the time of election. Nonetheless, the claims continue to spark frequent media debate over his moral integrity. In sexual offence cases comprising trial by media, the presumption of innocence is in favour of the woman while in fact and in law every person should be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. But at the same time it pertinent to question as to why no formal complaint was registered and an investigation was launched against the candidate to prove or disprove such allegation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCritics claim political affiliation may fetch the accused apparent impunity. Thus, a pervasive culture of impunity and accountability for abuses remain a serious concern in Nepal. Additionally, the distance between power held by men and by women has directly resulted in cycles of harassment, misconduct, and abuse. Consequently, the public are more sympathetic towards women. While it is important to protect the victim, it is also equally necessary that it should not be used as an agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">The President issued five ordinances</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 5 2022, President Bidya Devi Bhandari on recommendation of the Council of Ministers, has yet gain promulgated the ordinances to tackle punishment for rape and acid attack.

As of 23rd April, 19.4 million people have received the double dose of vaccination which is 66.8% of the total population. Similarly, the vaccination number for people receiving at least one dose and booster dose are 22.1 million (76.1%) and 2.7 million (9.4%). Currently, the population of Nepal between 0 and 14 stands at 28.8%. The government has plans to buy Pfizer vaccination approved by WHO for the children between 5 and 12 years and a non-disclosure agreement has already been signed for the purchase of 8.4 million doses. Despite having vaccines in stock, the government has failed to vaccinate the entirety of the eligible population by mid-April as initially planned. The Covid-19 cases have been increasing in India over the past week. Furthermore, Nepali people living in India are expected to move back to the country for the upcoming local elections. Since a significant percentage of population is yet to be vaccinated, Covid-19 cases might increase in the upcoming days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal has received around 52.08 million doses of vaccines which include AstraZeneca, Vero Cell, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen, and Sinovac-CoronaVac. According to a committee formed to investigate the missing vaccines, found lapses from the government in vaccine management due to which thousands of vaccines were either expired or ruined. Most of the instances of improper vaccine handling were found at the local. This could be due to lack of proper training on the handling of vaccines and lack of storage facilities at local level. Similarly, with a significant percentage of population yet to be vaccinated, the vaccination number has plateaued over the past few weeks. One of the major causes for this is lack of confidence on the efficacy of vaccines. False information regarding the side-effects of vaccination has been widely spreading across the social media which has negatively impacted people’s decision to get vaccinated. Hence, there is a need for fact checking institutions to control the spread of misinformation. Likewise, the government also has an important role in getting connected with the people and persuading them to take vaccines. Furthermore, there are no measures to screen the Covid-19 cases at the border points for the people returning back to Nepal. So, to address this issue of possible Covid-19 wave, government should focus on vaccinating the remaining population and establish the pre-existing infrastructure including screening at border points and quarantine and isolation centers. Similarly, WHO director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus arrived in Nepal to discuss the progress of Covid-19 vaccination. During this visit, Nepali health officials have asked for WHO’s help to establish Nepal as a regional hub for tropical medicine which could be instrumental for Nepal to improve its existing health infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Issues regarding Budi Gandaki Hydropower Project Contract</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has decided to undertake the mega Budi Gandaki Hydropower Project with the capacity of 1200 MW through the national investments. Similarly, the cabinet of minister with the recommendation from the Ministry of Energy has decided to revoke the contract with the China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) which is a Chinese state-owned company for the construction of the dam. In 2018, the KP Oli government had awarded the contract to the Chinese company without free competition. This decision was publicly criticized because CGGC has been blacklisted in several countries due to its dodgy records. Chinese ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi expressed dissatisfaction regarding the government’s decision. This project is an example of how frequent political changes have impacted the infrastructure development projects in Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2006, the then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal signed the agreement with Gezhouba for the construction of Budhi Gandaki Hydropower. However, the Sher Bahadur Deuba led government in 2014 took the project from Gezhouba and highlighted that it will be constructed through internal investments. The decision was again reversed by KP Oli in 2018. So, the indecision from the government has put the future of the project in a limbo. One of the most important aspects while undertaking any big infrastructure is policy continuity. However, no progress has been made on the project due to multiple policy changes regarding the financing of the project. According to a report prepared in 2015, the project was estimated to cost around Rs 270 billion. Currently, it is estimated that the project will cost more than Rs 1 trillion taking inflation into factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Cross-Border Electricity Trade</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, during the visit of PM Deuba to India, a ‘Joint Vision Statement on Power Co-operation/Common Vision Agreement’ has been signed to facilitate the development of hydropower projects through joint investments and strengthen the cross-border electricity mechanisms. This comes as a great opportunity for Nepal to expand its electricity export prospects through the regional framework of SAARC and BIMSTEC. Thus, Nepal should be extra careful to not derail the development of hydropower projects for maximum capitalization of the provisions under the agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Security Preparation for Local elections</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the major concerns regarding the local elections happening on May 13 is addressing the issue of party rifts during the election. All the district administrations have been directed to keep an eye out party rifts which could ultimately lead to clashes between the party cadres. In previous elections, armed groups trying to disrupt the election process was a major cause for concern. During this election cycle, Ministry of Home Affairs has identified clashes and violence among party members as a major security threat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo address the security challenges, the security agencies including Nepal Army, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, and National Investigation Department will be mobilized. Security agencies have categorized polling station as ‘sensitive’ and ‘highly sensitive’ depending on the perceived security threat at each station. Similarly, organizations such as Himal Surakshya Parishad and Mongol Nepal Organization have been recognized as possible security threat. Although Netra Chandra Bikram led communist party and CK Raut led Janamat party have joined mainstream party politics, security officials have been directed to closely monitor their activities. To maintain the security during the elections, 65,000 personnel of Nepal Police, 71,000 personnel of Nepal Army, and 32,000 personnel of Armed Police Force will be deployed. Similarly, India-Nepal border will be closed for 72 hours to prevent the electoral fraud. Furthermore, security officials have also been directed to keep an eye out on the activities of refugees and undocumented migrants.

The visit was seen as an attempt to reset ties, regain Indian confidence, and reduce the trust deficit between the two countries by addressing Indian concerns and priorities. Bishnu Puskar Shrestha was nominated as Nepal’s ambassador for China making his nomination notable for reasons because he is primarily a teacher by profession along with being a human rights activist and conflict victim of the decade-long Maoist insurgency without a background in diplomacy. Nepal’s current foreign policy behaviour also demonstrates a tilt towards the United States and India and away from China. Nepal hosted a US Congressional delegation of four, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand who arrived for a four-day visit. The visit comes at a time when Nepal and the United States are celebrating 75 years of friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Timeline of Major Events</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Year</th>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Event</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>1 April</td>\r\n			<td>Prime Minister Deuba’s leaves for his visit to India from April 1-3.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>2 April</td>\r\n			<td>Nepal-India signed Joint Vision Statement on Power Sector Cooperation for mutually beneficial cooperation on hydroelectricity g</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>8 April</td>\r\n			<td>Nepal nominates 20 new ambassadors including China.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>21 April</td>\r\n			<td>Hou Yanqi, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal addresses bilateral issues in a press conference.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>22 April</td>\r\n			<td>A US Congressional delegation of four, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand arrived in Nepal on 22 April for a four day visit.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal-China</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chinese Foreign Minister, Wangi Yi’s visit in late March demonstrated that despite differences over issues such as the ratification of MCC, border row in Humla, and BRI, China wants to continue engaging Nepal. For instance, in a recent interview with Global Times, the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi stated that “Nepal should become a demonstration garden for friendly cooperation among countries, not a fighting ring for geopolitical games”. Thus, it is likely that traditional Chinese assistance through aid and cooperation on construction and military support will continue upon the agreed frameworks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Nepal featured heavily in China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative in South Asia, there has been little headway on the project. The Chinese Foreign Minister’s visit to Nepal in late March sparked debated deliberations over whether it would move forward. However, further developments on BRI seem less likely as commercial loan based development projects seem unaffordable given Nepal’s economic priorities. Furthermore, in a press conference, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, Lou Hanqi, clearly stated that BRI was a loan based project and would not be possible under frameworks of traditional assistance or aid while sharing her views on the bilateral cooperation between the two nations. When asked about the construction of the cross border railway, she said that the project is geologically complex, therefore China and Nepal need to come to agreement on the technical and financing aspects, mentioning that a feasibility study alone for a project of that scale would take upto 6 years. She also reiterated the “Three Supports” statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry after Foreign Secretary Wang Yi’s visit to Nepal. While China has time and again asserted that it supports Nepal in its path to economic development, bilateral initiatives and projects have failed to pick up pace including BRI.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Appointment of New Ambassador to China</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The government of Nepal recommended a list of ambassadors for 20 countries on April 8 after a long hold up. Shankar Sharma and Sridhar Khatri were recommended as ambassadors to India, the United States respectively on October 28 2021, without a nomination for China because of the lack of consensus over the candidates among the ruling parties. This makes the recent appointment of Bishnu Puskar Shrestha notable for various reasons. Shrestha is a human rights activist and conflict victim of the decade-long Maoist insurgency, without a background in diplomacy. Therefore, his appointment as the ambassador to China, a country often in headlines for its alleged human rights violations, seems odd if not an uninformed foreign policy choice. A Wechat media page also noted that the appointment of the new Nepali ambassador to China is unprecedented in Nepali politics and describes him as an “ordinary person who is relatively unfamiliar in foreign affairs and relations with China”.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal-India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Prime Minister Deuba’s visit to India right after the departure of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was his first foreign trip after assuming office in 2021. The visit was seen as an attempt to reset ties and regain Indian confidence which had been shaky since the border row at Kalapani in 2020. It was marked by the signing of traditional agreements and inaugurations and was also described by analysts as a “major breakthrough in Nepal-India relations”. Prime Minister Deuba and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi discussed bilateral cooperation on energy trade, hydropower development, and connectivity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to reports, both Prime Minister’s also agreed to resolve the long outstanding border dispute over Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiaduria areas through bilateral dialogue. The Foreign Secretary of India Harsh Vardhan Shringla further stressed the importance and effectiveness of diplomatic dialogue, citing that the border dispute between Bangladesh and India was successfully resolved through bilateral dialogue. He also urged that the border row not be politicized. The comment was possibly in reference to Nepal’s upcoming elections wherein such issues become a part of a politician or party’s agenda and border related disputes tend to flare up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most notable development between the two countries was the finalization of a vision statement to strengthen cooperation on the joint development of power generation projects in Nepal for mutually beneficial cooperation on hydroelectricity generation, transmission and cross-border trade. Kul Man Ghising, the Managing Director of Nepal Electricity Authority noted that India’s positive attitude towards energy cooperation and trade with Nepal is “an important milestone for Nepal’s power sector development”. This is a departure from India’s previous reluctant position on the matter as it is now openly endorsing the prospect of bilateral and multilateral cooperation on energy trade. Furthermore, Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources of the Bangladeshi government also remarked that Bangladesh can import surplus electricity from Nepal during the summer and monsoon seasons and both of them will benefit if they take electricity from Bangladesh when Nepal’s power generation decreases in the winter season”. Such developments are a positive step towards the revitalization of regional and sub-regional frameworks such as BBIN and BIMSTEC, important for Nepal to expand power trade beyond India and invite foreign investment in hydropower projects in Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertain aspects of the trip were more symbolic in nature. For instance, Prime Minister Deuba and his wife Arju Deuba visited Banaras and offered prayers at the Kaal Bhairav and Kashi Vishwanath Temples. Arju Deuba remarked on the cultural oneness between India and Nepal. Prior to the visit to Banaras, Prime Minister Deuba and Mrs. Arju Rana Deuba had visited the headquarters of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the very day they landed in Delhi. This marked the first time a Nepali politician and sitting Prime Minister has visited a political party office in India. Although Deuba has long been viewed as being close to New Delhi, it was associated with the linkages to the Indian National Congress (INC). Therefore, the visit to BJP headquarters appears all the more notable. Overall, Prime Minister Deuba demonstrated earnest efforts to reduce the trust deficit between the two countries and regain Indian confidence by addressing Indian concerns and priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal-US:</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A US Congressional delegation of four, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand arrived in Nepal on 22 April for a four day visit. The American delegation’s visit came a month after the Foreign Secretary of China, Wang Yi’s three-day visit to Nepal in late March followed by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s visit to India in early April. While the Senators held talks with Prime Minister Deuba in Baluwatar, they also met with KP Sharma Oli, former Prime Minister and chair of the main opposition, CPN-UML and also called on Pushpa Kamal Dahal, former Prime Minister and chair of Maoist Centre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe formal visit to Nepal was to cover a wide range of agendas such as bilateral cooperation and economic development, traditional aid and assistance, Tibetan refugees, and climate change. The Senators thanked Nepal for the ratification of the highly politicized MCC compact. Since the visit was also a part of the delegation’s international tour in show of solidarity for Ukraine, the US lawmakers thanked Nepal for voting in favor of Ukraine in the United Nations General Assembly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal will be hosting the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Uzra Zeya who is currently serving as the United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues. She set to arrive right in Kathmandu before the local elections on May 13. Her visit comes at a time where United States has been exerting pressure to provide identity cards to Tibetan refugees living in Nepal. However, Nepal has been treating the Tibetan issue with caution. Nepal acknowledges that Tibet is China’s internal matter which makes it a geopolitically sensitive issue for Nepal. Thus, issuing refugee cards could result in major repercussions for Nepal and its bilateral ties with China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe flurry of high level foreign visits and engagements indicates that the tumultuous US-Nepal relationship before the ratification of the compact has been thawing. This is also a good opportunity for Nepal to capitalize on the United States’ increasing geopolitical interests and engagements towards fulfillment of Nepal’s national interests, pursuit of economic advancement and infrastructure development.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal has once again found itself amidst heightened geopolitical activity with various powers trying to find an equilibrium. While the ratification of MCC and the Prime Minister’s visit to India at its heels demonstrates Nepal’s tilt towards the United States and India, it does not necessarily mean it has fallen out of favor with China because China has shown consistent efforts to continue engaging Nepal despite setbacks. Nepal must avoid mistakes of the past and respond in a way that it can capitalize off of great power interest. This is as an opportunity to formulate a synthesized, consistent and balanced foreign policy that best serves Nepal’s national interests and development goals with consensus among all political parties.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670755065_RoS-KTM-Newdelhi-PMDeubab-scaled-e1648893591909-1536x1167-1.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-04', '2022-05-26', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 22:22:45', '2022-12-11 22:22:45'),

According to Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) data for the first eight months of the current fiscal year (FY) 2021/22, Nepal’s import bill has increased by a whopping 36.1 percent or by Nrs. 344.12 billion. Corresponding to the same report, the outflow of forex (foreign reserves) stands at 84.4 percent (from imports of goods), whereas the inflow of the same stands at a meager 7.7 percent (from the export of goods). Similarly, remittance has also reduced by a large margin, plummeting by Nrs. 20.74 billion year-on-year during the first eight months of the current fiscal. Considering this, the ongoing forex crisis has exacerbated; with the general public anticipating an economic upheaval in the upcoming days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While Nepal’s current forex crisis was long in building due to its huge dependency on the import of goods and services alongside years of neglect by the government to incentivize domestic manufacturing and exporting capacity, the crisis is not as dire as individuals are assuming it to be. With the country discarding most of its Covid-19 restrictions, demand for imported goods was bound to increase. Looking at it empirically, Nepal’s total imports bill for the first eight months of the current fiscal stands at Nrs. 1308.73 billion, which is a 38.6 percent increment, year-on-year. Being an import-dependent nation, this is not an alarming figure. Moreover, according to the same report, the country still has forex enough to sustain imports (both merchandise imports and merchandise and service imports) for the next 6.7 months. With the economy running in the ninth month of the current fiscal; one can rationally assume that the economy does have sufficient foreign reserves to sustain imports until the formulation, introduction, and implementation of a new national budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, falling remittance earnings are a concern. Drawing reference from the same report, remittances sent home from domestic migrant laborers have been reduced by 1.7 percent year on year. Nevertheless, this too is a short-lived problem that has been propelled by the rising domestic inflation. With global prices (goods and services) at an all-time high due to uncertainties inflicted by the Russia-Ukraine crisis; prices for most basic goods, commodities, and necessities in the domestic market have increased. This is depleting domestic savings; ultimately pushing individuals to use/depend on remittance earnings/savings. Factoring all these together, one can say that today’s depleting forex crisis is a short-term phenomenon that is being heavily publicized by political leaders instead of focusing on and addressing more concerning matters like the rising liquidity crunch and prices of petroleum and gasoline products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Suspension of governor: an attack on NRB’s autonomy</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The government on 08 April 2022 suspended the central banker – Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari, accusing him on charges of leaking sensitive information and not being able to execute his responsibilities effectively. Following this, the government formed a three-member investigation committee headed by the former Supreme Court Justice, Purushottam Bhandari; giving them a month to submit their investigation report. However, the Supreme Court on 19 April 2022 reinstated Adhikari as the governor of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), further telling the government not to implement its decision to suspend him.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The government’s decision to suspend the governor at a time when the economy is undergoing an economic crisis has left many wondering if the concerned government authorities have their priorities right. Market observers and economists have referred to Adhikari’s suspension as a clear reflection of the growing discontentment between the executive and the central bank. Apprehensions between the governor and the finance minister started rising as early as during the introduction of the monetary policy for the current fiscal back in August of 2021. With most provisions aimed at limiting equity investments, the stock market fell drastically; irking the finance minister. Fast forward to 2022, the central bank imposed various import ceilings on luxury items and other commodities as a precautionary measure to mediate the rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves. This too did not sit well with the finance minister. Similarly, the governor’s repeated affirmation where he acknowledged that the economy would not be able to achieve the growth target of 7 percent went against the finance minister’s projections; once again vexing him. The biggest fallout came when Adhikari refused to recognize a shady transfer of Nrs. 400 million from an unidentified source in the US to a businessman (Prithvi Bahadur Shah); which the finance minister has been reported to allegedly protecting/hiding from coming out to public knowledge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsidering all these, the decision to suspend the governor can be rightly termed as an executive encroachment on the autonomy of the central bank and its functions. Finance Minister Janardan Sharma had long been at loggerheads with the central banker, which was particularly exacerbated by many events that occurred in recent months. Moreover, the move to suspend the governor has also sparked tensions within the coalition government, with many referring to the decision coming on the behest of Prime Minister Deuba’s partner – the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre). However, the Supreme Court’s decision to curtail the government’s decision has shown that while the executive might attack independent institutions – such as the central bank (which are meant to keep a check on the former’s behavior), personal interest/tussles should never be the reason of disturbance in the functioning of independent and autonomous bodies nor their leaders.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670755740_Maha-Prasad-Adhikari.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-04', '2022-05-26', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 22:34:00', '2022-12-16 19:41:47'),

However, electoral coalitions couldn’t materialize in quite a lot of local bodies. Only in about twelve of seventy-seven districts, the ruling alliance could forge an electoral coalition at all the local levels. The coalition at various local levels seemed to be either in dilemma or broken as the distribution of seats among the various parties raised conflict and indecision. This is evident from the fact that the coalition in most of the local bodies required sustained efforts till the last minute to materialize. In districts like Rolpa, Humla Dailekh, and Hetauda among others, the five parties’ electoral coalition got dismissed due to the disagreements among the parties for the mayoral seat. The sharing of seats as the only concerning issue for the parties in coalitions is reflective enough of the fact that the only objective of electoral alliances is to win elections rather than represent people with the best intentions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe deadline for the submission of candidacy was April 25, 2022; and over 100,000 thousand candidacies were filed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Notion of decentralization in limbo</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The central authority of each party has intervened to select a consensus candidate in almost all the metropolitan and sub-metropolitan cities which in itself is against the essence of decentralization and local polls. The role of the central authority of each party in forging coalitions also caused interparty and intraparty disputes. The local units of parties felt that impositions of the centre’s decisions could encumber the prospects of electoral successes. The five-party ruling alliance has divided seats amongst themselves in 17 major cities—6 metropolitan cities and 11 sub-metropolitan cities – with a consensus among top leaders. However, in those cities, the local units of the parties seem unsatisfied with the decisions of the parties’ top leaders. For instance, the ruling alliance’s decision to give the mayoral position of the Janakpurdham sub-metropolitan city and Birgunj submetropolitan city to the candidate of the People’s Socialist Party has left Congress dissatisfied – and the case is similar in Pokhara Metropolitan City. This has led to protests by the Nepal Congress local leaders and cadres in each of those local bodies. Thus, while the formation of an electoral coalition and selection of the candidates, in theory, were left at the local discretion, the unfolding coalition politics revealed the centralized nature of Nepali politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Voters increased throughout the country</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Voters throughout the nation have increased by almost 45 lakhs compared to the last local election. 2017 election registered 1 crore 54 lakh voters, whereas the upcoming election, although the election commission has not received full numbers from all the district election offices, till date accounts for 1 crore 84 lakh voters. The increase in voters can be reasoned with the marriages bringing in an additional female population, citizens returning from abroad who have shown more interest in registering on the voters’ list than in prior elections, and also because many citizens are now more aware of their voting rights. The addition of voters not only shows the interest of the citizens to participate in electing deserving candidates but also brings changes regarding the addition of polling stations, security challenges to manage the additional voting population, increased mobilization of security forces, and increased monitoring of the polling station and maintaining transparency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Election security and deployment of security forces</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the election security report submitted by the security committees on April 12 representing all the provinces, Madhes province is reported to be the most sensitive with 1065 polling stations labelled as highly sensitive.

Consequently, the report has stated that 2,946 polling stations are highly sensitive, 4,423 are sensitive and 3,387 are less sensitive nationwide. It is provided that the security challenges will be mitigated and forces will be deployed to the polling stations according to the report. The election commission has also issued Election Security (Directives), 2022, to manage, direct and supervise the challenges foreseen in the upcoming elections.

Back in March, the Nepali Congress – the biggest party of the ruling alliance – had decided to leave the election coalition for the upcoming local election at the local discretion. At the centre, there remained a broad consensus among top leaders of the five-party ruling alliance to contest the local polls together, and these parties reached an agreement on the framework of candidate selection on April 16. The alliance then successfully divided both mayoral and deputy mayoral posts for all metropolitan and sub-metropolitan cities amongst each other; however, this required sustained efforts and interventions from leaders at the centre. In most places other than these metropolitan and sub-metropolitan cities, the ruling alliance attempted to bring the election coalition into effect throughout the month. Only in about twelve of seventy-seven districts, the ruling alliance could reach a consensus for collaboration in all local bodies. In quite a few districts, the electoral alliance of ruling parties couldn’t materialize at all, and the Nepali Congress decided to contest on its own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the opposition front, CPN UML has forged an election alliance with two fringe parties – the newly formed Rashtriya Prajatantra Party Nepal which demands that Nepal be reinstated as a Hindu nation and the next, Nepal Pariwar Dal. In a few districts, CPN UML has also collaborated with other parties in the opposition – Loktrantik Samajbadi Party, and People’s Progressive Party among others. While UML leaders claim in public that their party can take on the ruling alliance on its own, UML’s desperate bid to find election partners reveals that, with the ruling alliance contesting polls together, an election coalition has now become more of a need than a choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Challenges of Electoral Coalitions</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ruling alliance has met with challenges to forge an election coalition primarily because a coalition between five different political parties at every local level is a difficult endeavour in itself. Each party has numerous aspirants for a limited number of posts, and a coalition between five different parties means that a consensus has to be reached for a single candidate from a pool of even larger sets of aspirants. To add to this, while in overall an electoral alliance could be helpful for all member parties of the coalition, not all parties can benefit equally from the alliance at every local level. This is because some parties have a stronger foothold in certain places, and sharing seats in those areas with others would be counterproductive. This is why the Nepali Congress – the biggest party of all among the five – backed out of an election alliance in several districts. And primarily for the same reason, the Shekhar Koirala faction of the Nepali Congress tried to push the party in contesting elections with no coalition whatsoever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe election coalitions between parties that neither share a common ideology nor policies mark the continuation of a trend in which political parties have reduced elections to mere strategic and number games. The true essence of elections in a democracy – contestation between ideas and policies – continue to remain sidelined.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Ongoing coalition politics against the spirit of decentralization</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These election coalitions for the local polls, however, reflect a paradox – while local bodies are envisioned to decentralize the state structure efficiently, the role of the central command of each party in pushing their local units to abide by the centre’s decisions is, in its very essence, against the spirit of decentralization. For federalism to function smoothly, it is imperative that political parties should adapt to the decentralized state structure, and provide their provincial and local units with autonomy in the decision-making process. To make the matter worse, these electoral coalitions are also largely driven by the motivations and interests of the party’s top leaders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Nepali Congress, through an electoral alliance for the local polls, seeks to save the ruling alliance till the next round of provincial and federal elections – and by doing so, aims to return back as the largest party in the federal and provincial parliaments. This is evident from the fact that the Nepali Congress’s centre forced its local units – particularly in Chitwan and Pokhara among other districts– to ally with other parties, despite those units going to great lengths to contest the local polls on their own. Other parties of the ruling alliance are also prioritizing election coalitions more so in preparation for the next cycle of provincial and federal elections than for the forthcoming local polls. The same is true for the opposition parties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe central level of each party intervening in the functioning and role of their local units herald difficult days ahead for the efficient practices of federalism. With local polls approaching, problems and agendas of the local levels should have been in the focus but the coalition talks at the centre have overshadowed all those issues of local bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Government in Controversy over the Suspension of Nepal Rastra Bank’s Governor</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 8, Nepal Rastra Bank’s governor Maha Prasad Adhikari was suspended after the government decided to form a three-member investigation committee labelling serious charges of leaking sensitive information and incompetence against him. According to Section 22 and sub-section 5 of Nepal Rastra Bank Act-2002, a governor can be suspended if they fail to do the due diligence, harm the country’s banking and if they are found to act dishonestly or with mala fide intention among other reasons. However, on April 19, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order, responding to the petition filed by governor Adhikari, and asked the government to not implement the suspension.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government’s move to suspend the governor was criticized by the opposition, and also by some leaders of the ruling alliance itself. They claimed that the government, specifically, the finance minister, attempted to shift the blame on the governor for the ensuing economic crisis. Nepal is getting mired in an economic crisis as the foreign reserves are dwindling and remittances have been low ever since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The opposition UML has ratcheted up its attack against the government with an accusation that PM Deuba’s government has led the country toward economic uncertainty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe economic crisis was long in the making, and the Oli-led government is equally responsible for this, but Oli and his acolytes are trying to use this crisis as an election strategy against the ruling alliance. The government, on the other side, instead of seeking constructive solutions, has attempted to shift the blame on the governor. Although it is within the prerogative of the government to take action against the governor, the investigation committee is accused to have consisted of members loyal to the finance minister Sharma which further adds to doubts over the credibility of the move. It was reported that while PM Deuba was keen to take action against the finance minister Janardan Sharma, he finally backed off fearing such a move could escalate tensions, on the eve of the local polls, with a member party of the ruling alliance – CPN Maoist. At the broader level, this entire controversy is a microcosm of a trend in which autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies are paralyzed by the executive with the motive of serving parties’ or leaders’ interests.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Sourav Dahal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670757402_2013_CA_Election_of_Nepal_071650538835_1200.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-04', '2022-05-26', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 23:01:42', '2022-12-11 23:01:42');

However, the Sher Bahadur Deuba administration on March 15, 2022, decided to prorogue the ongoing session of Parliament without a single bill being endorsed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe aforementioned Ordinances were brought before the house for the second time on December 22, 2021, and have become inactive due to lack of approval from the parliament within the minimum stipulated period of 60 days as per the Constitution of Nepal 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, the bill to amend the Nepali Citizenship (first amendment) ordinance, 2021 has been pending in parliament for two years. On March 8 2022, Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand took an initiative to forge a consensus on the bill relating to the amendment of Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006. On the occasion, Minister Khand stated that the government has been taking initiative to enact the amendment. According to a statement made by an official to the Kantipur; there exists different points-of-view amongst the political parties regarding the bill that is designed to amend the Nepal Citizenship Act 2006. In the absence of consensus and understanding within the alliance, the bill cannot be passed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLapse of ordinance has led to legal vacuum and the victim is devoid of any socio-legal protection. Government should be more proactive in passing laws of significance such as those on the violence against women, so as to deter the occurrence of such crimes by severely punishing the perpetrators. In any event, ratification of crucial bills, which if not endorsed on time, could bring about a perception that the parliament is neglecting its constitutional duties on its behalf.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, the session was concluded without any general discussion on the impeachment motion against Chief Justice Rana. In the motion, the ruling party lawmakers have made 21 allegations against Rana in an attempt to justify why he should be impeached.

On March 24, Tanahun District Court sent the actor to judicial custody for investigation. According to Section 219 of National Penal Code, 2017, where a man has sexual intercourse with a woman whose a minor even with her consent, the man shall be considered to commit rape on such woman or girl child. Under the Code, the age of consent is 18 years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAside from the above mentioned case of statutory rape, incidents of rape, sexual harassment and paedophilia have come to light in Morang district of late.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolice arrested two youths on charge of abducting, raping and killing an 18-month-old girl from Morang.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>year-old girl from Morang was sexually assaulted by a 56-year old school teacher who has a previous record of sexual harassment allegation but was pardoned by the school administration. In the present case, when the police went to the school to investigate, they were accused by the locals of trying to protect the perpetrator and were assaulted by a violent mob resulting in the death of a policewoman.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As evident in the present case, impunity not only enables perpetuation of violence but also erodes public trust in the justice system to an extent that a police officer becomes a victim of mob rage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the first seven months of current fiscal year, almost, 1,300 rapes were registered with the police out of which 40 percent were minor girls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is pertinent to note that, in addition to the law, society must also play a role in the prevention of such crimes. While it is important to stick to the letter of the law with regard to rape and sexual assault, it is also to be noted that the problem lies in the mindset of the perpetrator as it is not natural for an adult to get aroused or receive sexual gratification from children who have neither biologically developed nor have an understanding of sexual behaviour. Thus, the capability of abducting, serially raping and brutally killing a child is a perverted, egotistical, sociopathic sadist act with no sense of empathy or guilt says expert on mental health and behavioural sciences</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Law and Society</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Proposal to Amend Section 103 of the National Civil Code, 2074</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In another interesting development, the Nepal law commission proposed an amendment by adding a sub- clause (a) to section 103 of the National Civil Code, 2074. The amendment proposes that if a divorced woman remarries, the property taken from her ex-husband should be returned to her children with ex-husband and in the absence of her children with the ex-husband should be returned to ex-husband or to the next of kin of the ex-husband.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe proposal has been criticized by the women’s rights activists on the ground that it reflects the patriarchal mindset of the society. However, an alternative viewpoint is that the proposal has been introduced in order to curb abuse of legal provision thereby leading to equal protection for both the genders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Allowance of Rs 5,000 a month to each kidney, cancer and spinal injury patient</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ministry of Health and Population made a decision to give allowance for kidney, cancer and spinal injury patients. It is pertinent to note that, not all Patients with cancer, spinal paralysis and kidney disease will be given monthly allowance, there are certain exceptions to it. To avail the service, beneficiaries are required to submit a copy of National Identity Card or Certificate of Citizenship, a copy of birth certificate in case of minor and application to the ward office along with the recommendation of the doctor. The amount specified by the government will be deposited by the local government in the bank account.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile this is a good initiative from the government but there may appear some challenges in it’s implementation. For example, lack of citizenship or birth certificate could be a major hindrance for the poverty stricken citizens to avail this benefit. The lack of citizenship has deprived people of access to public services, social service including problems in opening bank accounts, enrolment in schools and applications for employment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, lack of transportation services in the rural part of Nepal may create hardship for the sick beneficiaries to travel to the Bank to receive their allowance. Many settlements in rural Municipality may not have motorable roads and banking services including e-banking. The program is not clear if the beneficiaries have to be physically present to receive the allowance at the designated banks or the allowance can be received on their behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">First National Conference of the Judicial Committee</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>President Bidya Devi Bhandari virtually inaugurated the first national conference of the judicial committees of the local governments. The purpose of the conference was to discuss the practices adopted and challenges faced by the Judicial Committee during its tenure and to formulate necessary strategies to resolve the problems at the local level. However, the deliberations at the conference have not been made public as yet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArticle 217 of the Constitution envisaged the creation of Judicial Committees in each of the 753 local level units. The purpose behind judicial committees is to ensure delivery of justice, in every sense of the word. The very idea of federal restructuring of Nepal was driven by the intention to decentralize and devolve authority and power down to the local level.

Yet the number of transactions on e-commerce platforms remains the same or at times, larger as compared to the lockdown days. Moreover, digital platforms have also recorded a 20 percent month-on-month growth in their transaction as compared to lockdown days; signaling shifting preference of customers on digital shopping over physical visits to nearby stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The rise of online/digital shopping is a huge achievement for the Nepali society which predominantly prefers traditional modes of shopping. While owners of digital/online businesses/platforms had feared being irrelevant post the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and the nationwide lockdowns; rising preference of online transactions comes as a huge relief to them. A major part of this development can be attributed to the country’s increasing access to internet services and other digital facilities. According to a report published by Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA) in December 2022Internet penetration has reached 119.49 percent of the population. Similarly, people performed online payments worth Nrs. 349 million (between mid-December 2021 to mid-January 2021). Despite this, awareness of e-commerce platforms in Nepal is still very low. According to the Business-to-Commerce E-Commerce Index 2020 (done by UNCTAD), Nepal ranked 113th in terms of internet awareness. Likewise, the nationwide digital literacy rate (as of 2019) among adults stands at only 31 percent; hampering optimum utilization of new technologies in the rapidly progressing digital sector. Timely delivery of goods has also been impacted by the lack of a proper addressing system for houses. Moreover, skills development services including – access to finance for e-commerce, tech start-up lags, low incentives (especially for women-led businesses) among others pose to be the major challenges for Nepal’s growing digital economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">NOC Increases Petroleum Prices, Increasing Inflation and External Deficit</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) on 16 March 2022, received a revised price list for petroleum products from its sole exporter, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). According to the new list, the price of petroleum products has reached an all-time high, wherein NOC is required to pay Nrs. 182.81, Nrs. 164.44, Nrs. 113.49, Nrs. 131.94, and Nrs. 114.51 per litre for petrol diesel, kerosene, aviation fuel (domestic) and aviation fuel (international), respectively. Similarly, the corporation is to pay Nrs. 2,240.34 per cylinder for cooking gas. With the revised list, market prices for the same products have been readjusted to Nrs. 150, Nrs. 133 (each), Nrs. 136, Nrs. 156, and Nrs. 1,575 per litre.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any increase in fuel and petroleum prices has rippling effects on economic sectors across the country; in particular the inflation rate. Nepal is dependent on imports for most of its basic necessities. Out of its Nrs. 153 trillion imports bill, it spends around roughly 20 percent or Nrs. 158 billion on importing petrol and fuel products. With most of the imported items coming via roadways, any increase in fuel prices automatically increases transportation cost; making prices of consumables (goods and other services) dearer. Moreover, according to Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) Inflation Expectation Survey Report Q2, 91.9 percent individuals expect prices of cereal grains, pulses, sugar, spices, oil, meat, real estate, drinks and tobacco, hotels and restaurants to increase in the next three months. Rising fuel prices are also anticipated to impact the growing trade deficit, in particular external deficit. Being a net importer of petroleum products, any changes in the global oil market bring about changes in Nepal’s external deficit which is outside the control of its domestic policies. Thus, with the Russia-Ukraine crisis, there is no doubt that Nepal’s trade deficit has widened with respect to the increasing global and domestic oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Weak Capital Expenditure Impacting Overall Economic Growth-</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG) of Nepal, the government has spent only 20 percent of its targeted capital expenditure within the first eight months of the current fiscal year (FY) 2021/22. In terms of numbers, the government has managed to spend only Nrs. 76.22 billion out of the allocated Nrs. 378 billion in the same period. Looking at the country’s total budget expenditure, the government has managed to spend Nrs. 672.90 billion out of Nrs. 1,632.82 billion or 41.21 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Slow and weak capital expenditure is not a new phenomenon in Nepal. It has been chronically impacting the economy and the government’s ability to utilize its resources. In any economy, economic growth and the government’s ability to spend money is directly correlated. Capital expenditure (in its essence) builds infrastructure and development projects. Successful completion of these projects attracts more investment vis-a-viz creating jobs and raising more revenue for the government to inject back into the economy. Yet the government in Nepal regularly fails to spend money on development activities. Weak capital spending results in the government producing shoddy and unprofessional infrastructure at the end of every fiscal year. Similarly, low budget on development activities also impacts job creation; by snatching jobs instead of creating it. The biggest implication of the current state of capital expenditure can be anticipated in the infrastructure deficit. With both planned and actual spending far below what is needed to close the infrastructure deficit, one can expect critical sectors like energy, transport, water supply and irrigation, and telecommunication to take the biggest hit; ultimately hampering revenue collection and the overall development of the nation.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670759058_RS_KTM_D3A93531-1-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-03', '2022-04-13', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-11 23:29:18', '2022-12-16 19:42:00'),

To address the security challenges of local election, Central Security Committee endorsed an integrated security plan. Similarly, Nepal Police announced the recruitment of 100,000 temporary police. The main role of temporary police officials is peacekeeping during the elections and safeguarding election booths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocal elections have different security implications including security threat against participants, infrastructure, information, and materials. One of the major concerns of any election is vote manipulation during the counting process. To tackle this issue, the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration has urged local levels to install CCTV cameras in vote counting centers. This way election commission can monitor the activities through CCTV camera. Some of the major issues during the Local Level Elections of 2017 were violence regarding the election, lack of voter’s education, violence against journalists, and abuse of alcohol for voter manipulation. The upcoming elections also present similar security challenges which need a coordinated effort from security apparatus, local governments, and the election commission to tackle these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Human-Wildlife Conflict</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, instances of human-wildlife conflict have increased. In Salyan more than 100 families have been displaced due to animals from Banke National Park destroying agriculture and livestock. To address these issues, a joint meeting between the wildlife officials of Nepal and India was conducted on March 2. Human-Wildlife conflict has been a growing issue which has resulted in agriculture, livestock, and even human life loss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a report, instances of conflict are present in around 90 percent of the districts in Nepal. Most of these occur along the buffer zone areas of national parks. In recent years, the hilly region of Nepal has also been highly susceptible to human-wildlife conflict. To accommodate the needs of growing population, human settlements have altered the land use pattern by clearing forests to make room for agricultural land. Furthermore, climate change may also have added to this problem by disrupting the natural ecosystem. The habitat destruction of animals has enabled them to move closer to the human settlements. For instance, every year wild elephants wreak havoc in terai which is mainly caused by disruption of their migration pattern due to the fragmentation of their habitat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has been found that human fatalities are mainly caused by elephants and leopards. So, nationwide research should be conducted to identify the major human-wildlife conflict hotspots. This would help to develop strategies such as construction of electric fences to reduce the conflict. Similarly, deploying different techniques such as building predator proof corrals and planting unpalatable crops to wildlife will be helpful in protecting agriculture. Along with protecting vulnerable communities, it is equally important to protect the wildlife. So, development of wildlife corridors could be effective in resolving these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Implications of Chure destruction</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The United Nations General Assembly has declared 2022 as the International Year of Sustainable Mountain Development. Hence, the Ministry of Forests and Environment has planned to organize a “Regional Policy Dialogue on Sustainable Mountain Solutions’ on March 23rd and 24th which will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. According to the IPCC report published in 2022, mountain ecosystems are some of the most vulnerable regions to the impact of climate change. Around 86% of Nepal’s total landmass is covered by Chure, Mahabharata, highlands, and mountains. Similarly, Chure covers around 13% of Nepal’s landmass. Chure range has undergone unchecked degradation for decades for the extraction of mineral stones. Furthermore, the government legalized the extraction of pebbles and sand mines for export to minimize the trade deficit. Around 60% of the country’s total population is dependent on the environmental services provided by the range. The impact of these activities is already evident in the changing rainfall patterns, flooding, and landslides.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAround 5 million people live in the Chure region, and their livelihood is dependent on agriculture and community forestry. Similarly, Chure region is one of the major watersheds for terai region. A study conducted in the Kamala River basin indicated that Chure degradation has impacted people’s access to water, rainfall pattern, and groundwater availability. Various environmentalists have highlighted that the government’s move to legalize extraction of pebbles, stones, and sands from Chure will lead to the desertification of terai region.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Air Pollution</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After recording the highest air quality index, Kathmandu has become the most polluted city in the world.

Air pollution levels get dangerous to the extent that daily activities also get obstructed as indicated by the shutting down of schools last year. Farmers burning residue of the crops and forest fires are the two major causes of worsening air pollution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe air pollution poses a significant threat, especially to the older population and people with respiratory ailments. Short term impacts of worsening air conditions are irritation in the eyes, nose, throat, and shortness of breath. Similarly, long term impacts include impacts on immune defense, and respiratory infections including pneumonia.

Furthermore, in order to effectively implement the rights enshrined under the aforementioned Articles, the Supreme Court, in consultation with the stakeholders, has called for revision and strengthening of the existing policies and laws.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn line with the constitutional commitment for protection and empowerment of Dalits, the Government of Nepal has developed targeted programmatic interventions. Such interventions are to include reservation of 9% for Dalits in the civil services; 15% reservation in military and security services; reservations in technical education etc; scholarships for Dalit students in public schools and higher educational institutions; social security allowances; children’s nutrition allowance; and the Peoples’ Housing Program. However the said intervention has been severely criticized for its poor implementation and lack of proper planning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is pertinent to note that, the Dalit Community of Nepal, at its 37th Session of Human Rights Council (Working Group on Universal Periodic Review) expressed its grievances regarding severe discrimination and violence faced by them. The report submitted by them recommends enactment of a unified law to ensure effective implementation of fundamental rights of Dalits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Prakash Nepali filed a petition before the SC, seeking a writ of mandamus, wherein he pleaded for enactment of separate law to ensure effective implementation of fundamental rights of Dalits in line with Article-40 which came to be rejected. Nevertheless, Supreme Court, while interpreting the Constitution, issued a directive as to the implementation of the rights and entitlements of the Dalit community. Advocate Nepali regards the order of the Supreme Court to be a historic landmark as it adopts the recommendations put-forth in the 37th Session of Human Rights Council. Concurrently, it may be equally important for the society to change their collective attitudes and outlook towards Dalits in order to effect positive change.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Dalit Representation in State Apparatus</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from cast-based discrimination that the Dalit community faces on a daily basis, they have minimal representation in the state apparatus. A National Human Rights Commission report from 2021 depicted that of the total 88,578 workers in government services, just 1,971 are Dalits, accounting for 0.2 %. According to the research, the Dalit group has a 9.45 % representation in Nepal Police, an 8.14 % representation in the Nepal Army, and a 1% representation in the judicial system. The recent promotion of Sita Pariyar to the position of Chief District Officer (CDO) of Humla may be seen a milestone in terms of social and civil liberation as she is the first woman from the Dalit community to become a CDO. Santa Bahadur Sunuwar is the CDO of Bardiya and Man Bahadur Bishwakarma was the first CDO from the Dalit community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Violence against women and children</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Accused convicted in Bhagirathi Bhatta Rape Case</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>District Court Baitadi has sentenced Dinesh Bhatta to 12.5 years imprisonment for the rape and subsequent murder of Bhagirathi Bhatta. The sentence was awarded on the basis of statements that Dinesh gave to the police as well as the court in addition to his DNA test.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn February 3, 2021, Bhagirathi Bhatta, 17, from Baitadi was raped and murdered brutally. Her body was recovered from the Tawalek Community Forest on February 4. The police arrested the perpetrator on February 16, 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Domestic violence rampant in Mahottari District of Madesh Province.</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Data released by the District Police Office, Mahottari for the past six months showed that domestic violence is rampant in this region. Statistics from July to mid-December, 2021, showed about 256 registered complaints of domestic violence. According to the police, most complaints were regarding physical assault and cruelty by the in-laws in the absence of a husband. Likewise, complaints have been lodged against the husband for physical assault and cruelty including denial of citizenship, childbirth, marriage registration and other documents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to experts, in addition to domestic violence against women, there exist other incidents of violence such as rape and murder and the victims have been denied justice owing to political influence in such cases. Furthermore, when the cases of violence against women are registered in court, the victims are subjected to undue pressure while making their statements which consequently weakens the credibility of their testimonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Human Rights Violation in Karnali and Gandaki Province</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Human Rights Year Book 2022 released by Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC) of Karnali Pradesh revealed that 430 incidents of human rights violations took place in 2021. 396 incidents of Human Rights violations were registered in the year, of which 320 were women and the rest were men. Furthermore, 205 cases of violence against women, 80 cases of rape, six cases of attempted rape and 29 cases of sexual abuse was recorded. In the year 2020, 426 incidents of Human Rights violation were registered, of which 332 are women and the rest are men.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the incidents of human rights violations have decreased in Karnali compared to 2020, there is no significant improvement. Custodial death, murders by family members and intimidation have increased. According to the Year Book, in 2021, two people died in prisons, 34 people including 20 women and 14 men were murdered, and 12 suffered intimidation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, Gandaki province records show that 125 women and 54 children were victims of human rights violations in the past six months. Amongst the violence against children, 39 are rape victims, six victims of sexual harassment, seven of corporal punishment, one of child marriage, and one infanticide. Amongst the violence perpetrated against women, six are rape victims, six are victims of rape attempt, and one each of sexual harassment, polygamy, and human trafficking, while domestic violence was recorded against 99.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite both men and women suffering, the data above indicates that women are more likely to be victims of human rights violations. Deprivation of rights of women and children including violence against them is prevalent. Non-implementation of the constitutional system is one of the main reasons for the increasing number of human rights violations. According to the National Human Rights Commission, coordination among the three tiers of the Government is imperative for effective implementation of laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Child Sexual Abuse Increased</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An examination of the data collected by the Nepal Police in the last two and a half years up to the fiscal year 2019/2020 shows a significant increase in the incidence of child sexual abuse. In the fiscal year 2019/2020, 244 children were sexually abused. This number increased to 304 in FY 2020/2021. As of mid-December of the current Fiscal Year 2021/2022, 121 children have been sexually abused in the last six months. Analysing the data of 671 cases of child sexual abuse in a period of two and a half years, 386 children (about 58 percent) are in the age group of 11 to 16 years. 239 children (about 36 percent) are under the age of 10. Many cases of child sexual abuse go unreported as the victims are threatened either directly or indirectly by perpetrators.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Safe Foreign Migration of Nepali Workers</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On January 24, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a circular restricting Nepali nationals from flying to Malaysia and other Gulf countries under visit visa, until further notice. The decision was made after receiving multiple complaints of exploitation and inhuman treatment of Nepali workers in the UAE. However, the government has laid down number of exemptions to this restriction. Minister for Labor, Employment and Social Security Krishna Kumar Shrestha, representing the government for the management of Nepalis stranded in the UAE will soon visit the said country, with an aim to facilitate implementation of bilateral labor agreement reached between the two countries. This is an initiative carried out by the government to make foreign employment safe and orderly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the aforementioned directive, the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security has decided to re-issue labor permits to the domestic workers traveling to gulf countries in order to confer legal status to the domestic workers currently residing at the destination country without a work permit. Prior to this decision, the Government had imposed restrictions on traveling of domestic workers to the gulf countries with the exception of Jordan. The bilateral agreement signed between Nepal and Jordan is exemplary in terms of good practices. It is not the same with other countries. Nepali migrant workers have had a tragic history, where they have been abused, abducted and killed in Kuwait, Iraq, Malaysia. With an aim to protect the domestic migrant workers, the government ceased issuing labor approvals but this did not stop the migrant workers from taking illegal channels. Many workers feared coming back home to visit their family either due to fear of prosecution or being retained.

The decision would also allow more female workers to work in the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is also pertinent to note that, starting from 27 January 2022, the UAE government has covered the domestic workers in the Wage Protection System (WPS) which allows the employers to pay workers’ wages electronically through banks, exchange offices and financial institutions approved and authorized by the Central Bank”. This applies to all the domestic help professions stated in the law including housemaids, nannies, housekeepers, cooks, family drivers, security guards, gardeners, farmers, private coaches, private teachers, private nurses, private representatives, private agriculture engineers, sailors, shepherds, falcon care-taker and workers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the UAE has assured WPS for all domestic workers it remains to be seen if the same would cover migrant workers of other nationalities working in UAE, unless it is mentioned in the bilateral agreements and MoUs signed between Nepal and UAE.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1670823303_img-04.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-04-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 17:20:03', '2022-12-12 17:20:03');

The document has highlighted ten major areas for improvement including policy and legal reform, peace, security and crime control, institutional reforms and physical infrastructure, disaster management, and good governance among others. Under the policy and legal reform section, one of the actions that is outlined is drafting of a Border Security Act which is planned to be completed in a year. Nepal Armed Police Force along with the Home Ministry will be responsible for drafting the act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe plan to draft a Border Security Act comes after 20 years of drafting the Armed Police Act 2058 through which the Armed Police Force (APF) was assigned with protecting international borders. Similarly, the National Security Policy stipulates that Nepal Army is tasked with defending Nepal’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity from external infiltration and aggression. Although there are different organizations deployed for the protection of borders, there is no separate legal apparatus that binds these organizations together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe news comes at a time when Nepal is having border issues with both India and China. One of the reasons for the ongoing border disputes with China is the lack of proper surveillance of the border pillars. Similarly, the open border between Nepal and India poses security concerns for Nepal like human and goods trafficking, smuggling, and unchecked migration. According to K.C. (2019), smuggling and illegal cross border activities have increased over the years. Although National Security Policy encompasses certain aspects of borders, border security primarily focuses on territorial integrity. Thus, a separate legal document concerning border security is important in addressing these issues. Apart from the act, the ministry is also planning to prepare a digital profile of border posts between India and China within the next two years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo strengthen the border security of the country, the document proposes to increase the number of APF personnel in accordance with international standards and improve the existing infrastructure. A recent news regarding the lack of infrastructure for the APF personnel deployed at the Border Outpost (BOP) in Hilsa is indicative of the need to strengthen the existing infrastructure of APF.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the plan put forth by the ministry is important in addressing some of the pressing issues of the country, it is also very ambitious. For instance, the development of a software for thermal customized tracking system to monitor people and vehicular cross-border movement will require integrated planning and infrastructure. Amidst the political turmoil in the country, it will be interesting to observe how these plans will be implemented effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Ukraine Crisis: Implications for Nepal</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After the invasion of Russia on Ukraine, tensions have escalated around the world. Nepal’s Foreign Ministry has issued a statement urging all the parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint not to escalate tension. It has clarified that recognition of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent entities goes contrary to the provisions of the UN Charter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe immediate concern regarding the Ukraine crisis for Nepal is to ensure the safety of citizens living in Ukraine. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already issued a statement urging Nepali nationals living in Ukraine to return home. It is estimated that there are around 200 Nepali citizens living in Ukraine, however, the official number is unknown. Since Nepal doesn’t have an embassy in Ukraine, the embassy in Berlin oversees Ukraine issues. As the situation worsens, Nepal should plan on managing transportation facilities to bring them back to Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the major impacts of the ongoing crisis will be in the economic sector of the country. Ukraine is one of the important trading partners for Nepal. Nepal mainly imports raw materials like unrefined soybean and sunflower oil from Ukraine. Nepal’s industries are based on importing unrefined oils and exporting refined products. So, both import and export are likely to get impacted. Furthermore, Nepal is reliant on India for petroleum products, while India gets its majority petroleum from Russia. The price of petrol in Nepal has already reached historic level. The prices are further expected to rise in the coming days. This will add to the already worsening economic conditions of the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe long-term effects will be seen in geo-politics and foreign diplomacy. China’s failure to condemn Russia’s actions are reflective of its close ties with Russia, whereas America along with other NATO countries have heavily criticized the Russian move by imposing several economic sanctions and providing military support to Ukraine. The US along with the EU have also cut off several Russian banks from the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), which could ultimately result in ending the dollar’s hegemony in the East. This could intensify the US-China relations which will have direct implications for Nepal’s diplomacy as both the countries are important strategic partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Should Nepal legalize trading cryptocurrencies?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>India has announced that it will implement a 30% tax on the income from digital assets including trading and transferring of the cryptocurrencies and NFTs (Non-fungible Tokens). Similarly, it has also revealed its plans to launch a digital currency. Nepal, on the other hand has banned the trading of all sorts of cryptocurrencies. However, after India’s decision regarding cryptocurrencies and digital currency, Nepal will be closely following how this decision pans out in India. Furthermore, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has highlighted that it is conducting a feasibility study for introducing a digital currency of its own. There has been a huge debate within the country regarding the legalization of cryptocurrencies. As the countries around the world have moved towards legalizing cryptocurrencies, it is important for Nepal to conduct a study regarding its implications on the economy as well as the security of traders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough cryptocurrencies are banned in Nepal, it is estimated that the number of people involved in the trading could be in thousands. Recently, four people have been charged with the case of foreign exchange misappropriation for illegally investing in virtual currencies. The number of illegal traders has significantly increased in the last few years due to high returns in the investment. Even though traders have procured high returns in the last few years, it is highly volatile which could negatively impact traders (especially from low-income households). Additionally, it is unregulated which makes it an unreliable source for funds transactions. According to research, cryptocurrencies pose a significant threat to the financial market and the well-being of citizens through loss of investments due to market volatility, scams, and cyber-attacks. So, before legalizing cryptocurrencies, it is important to analyze the risks associated with the trading of cryptocurrencies. Similarly, financial institutions of Nepal should set up certain mechanisms to ensure the security of traders by focusing on trading literacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother important aspect associated with cryptocurrencies is mining. Mining is a process of creating a cryptocurrency which requires high processing computers and extensive electricity. Nepal has a surplus of hydroelectricity which can be used to create cryptocurrencies, which would ultimately improve the economy. Similarly, legalization of cryptocurrencies could aid in the international payment system by eliminating all the current hassles created by a third party (banks). Nepal being a country that is heavily dependent on international funds could hugely benefit from it once proper mechanisms are in place with proper currency regulations. Finally, Nepal could set up a tax bracket (like India) on the profits made from cryptocurrencies which would help generate capital for the government. Cryptocurrency is still in its infancy phase. Although legalization of cryptocurrency has a massive upside, it also has certain risks associated with it.</p>', NULL, 2811, NULL, NULL, 'Yunish Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670823844_Ukraine_AFP.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-02-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 17:29:04', '2022-12-16 19:39:55'),

The letter expressed the commitment to pass the MCC by the parliament. In response to the letter sent to the MCC board by the ruling coalition leaders, MCC has indicated that failing to ratify MCC in Parliament within February 28 may result in consequences like reductions in aid and foreign direct investments from the U.S. and other countries. The letter to the MCC headquarters is deemed to be against diplomatic dignity. The joint letter from the Prime Minister and chairman of another party is atypical practice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn February 10, U.S. Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu, in a telephone conversation with Deuba, KP Oli, and Dahal, conveyed that neither MCC would be amended nor the deadline for a parliamentary endorsement would be extended. He further added that the U.S. would believe that MCC was declined due to Chinese influence in Nepal. The U.S. ‘s adamance on not amending the compact is another dimension. This indicates that the U.S. has adopted a more coercive stance on the issue of the compact ratification in Nepal. The failure to ratify the compact may not bring about immediate reorientation of American foreign policy towards Nepal but it is likely to become a determining factor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the other hand, the Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on February 18 at a general press conference remarked that the U.S. is using “coercive diplomacy” in Nepal. Although China has maintained that it supports developed countries to increase international development cooperation projects to developing countries like Nepal, China has time and again expressed caution on the compact under different pretexts. Chinese statements at this point could aggravate Nepal’s already precarious geopolitical situation. Some analysts suggest that the statements made by the US or China show a cooperative attitude towards Nepal. Former Foreign Minister Dr. Bhes Bahadur Thapa says, “Their comments are not easy and not in the interest of Nepal.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the weaknesses of the Nepali leadership is its inability to grasp the fact that Chinese efforts to thwart U.S. projects and U.S. efforts to stop the Chinese are not new.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a country with a geopolitical situation like ours, the MCC is treated like any other internal political issue, ignoring the need for clarity, agility, and transparency in the context of such projects that could make a country the subject of its credibility. The issue of MCC illustrates Nepal’s propensity to view any issue from a geopolitical perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">China</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On February 8, BBC disclosed a confidential study report that claims that China attempted to create a permanent canal in Nepali territory. The report also says that the Chinese side has wired the Nepali territory from Kit Khola to Karnali River. China has been maintaining that there is no border dispute with Nepal. China also stated that BCC’s news report is smearing propaganda against China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, Nepal’s Minister of Communications and Information Technology has stated that the government will resolve border concerns through necessary diplomatic measures. He noted that the government was always attempting to resolve border-related issues. He also clarified that such problems are studied and resolved through the government’s mechanism by studying the reality at the appropriate time and releasing the official stance. The reluctance of the government to officially release the report on border issues with China shows that the fear element in Nepal-China relations is becoming dominant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal has an enormous trade deficit with China. Nepal purchased NRS 233.93 billion worth of goods from China in 2020-21, while it exported NRS 1 billion. This equated to a trade deficit of Rs 232. 90 billion, accounting for 14 percent of Nepal’s overall trade deficit in the fiscal year 2020-21. One of the reasons for the discrepancy in the volumes of trade between the two countries is the soft trade embargo since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. The virtual blockade continues to persist, with China imposing strict border restrictions. Regarding trade, China has shown no good neighborly behavior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, 50,000 metric tons of urea and 63,535 metric tons of DAP fertilizer imports have been halted due to the Chinese policy of stopping fertilizer exports. Diplomatic efforts at the government level have not been successful. As per the Agricultural Material Company, Chinese fertilizer producers were selling chemical fertilizers in the world market while Nepal was processing the contract. However, contractors refused to supply the fertilizer, saying that the government had stopped exporting. China has taken up a passive aggression approach towards Nepal, perhaps to show its displeasure regarding the surfacing of MCC. Moreover, China’s indifference towards Nepal conveys that Nepal cannot trust China.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>India announced its budget on February 1, where the aid for Nepal has dropped. In the fiscal year 2019-20, India allotted Rs. 16.8 billion to Nepal, which was later increased to 19.2 billion. In 2020-21 India’s aid to Nepal decreased by 33 percent. In the fiscal year 2022-23, Indian aid to Nepal is Rs. 12 billion, which is 24 percent less than that of the fiscal year 2022/23. The Indian aid allocation to Nepal in the past three years shows a downward pattern.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEffective in May, Indian travelers visiting Nepal will be able to use UPI, an online payment system. Nepalese payment service provider Gateway Payment Service Private Limited has reached an agreement with the National Payment Corporation of India to implement UPI in Nepal. India’s digital diplomacy is gaining traction. The decision would be a massive relief for Indians traveling to Nepal, as Nepal has only permitted the usage of Indian rupees in the denomination of 100.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Nepal-India Energy Secretary-level, joint Steering Committee meeting was halted since the Covid-19 pandemic. It was finally held on February 23. In the meeting, the aspects of power trade and bilateral cooperation. The discussion would encompass the export of 850 megawatts of power to India from the approaching monsoon, Butwal-Gorakhpur transmission line, Raxaul-Parwanipur transmission line, and New Nautanahawa-Mainiya transmission line. It is positive news that Nepal and India are making leaps and bounds in bilateral cooperation in the energy sector.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1670824360_RS_KTM__D3A65802-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-04-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 17:37:40', '2022-12-12 17:37:40'),

Initially, NOC on 02 February 2022, increased the prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene to Nrs. 142 per liter and Nrs. 125 per liter. Fast forward to eighteen days, the corporation on 20 February 2022 increased prices for petrol, diesel and kerosene to Nrs. 145 per liter and Nrs. 128 per liter. Moreover, with the Russia-Ukraine crisis, domestic fuel prices are forecasted to inflate anywhere between Nrs. 180-200 per liter in the upcoming days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepali economy has become accustomed to exorbitant hikes in gasoline and petroleum prices. However, the recent increase comes at a time when the economy is undergoing high rates of inflation. According to Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) monthly report – Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation of Nepal, inflation across the country has crossed the central bank’s ceiling limit of 6.5 percent to reach 7 percent within the first six months of the current fiscal. Similarly, prices of consumption goods including oil, lentils, rice and vegetables recorded a 64 months high point during the same review period. Considering this, the Russia-Ukraine crisis comes as a huge threat to smaller nations like Nepal which is completely dependent on importing fuel for its domestic demands. Any spike in global oil prices driven by global supply disruptions brings inflationary, fiscal and external risks to smaller economies. Analyzing this for Nepal, a global fuel crisis can directly hit the state’s exchequer. Similarly, as the country is reeling under a fuel imports bill of Nrs. 132.19 billion; Nepal’s foreign exchanges (FOREX) are expected to deplete faster in the upcoming days. With this, the current account deficit too is expected to widen. Moreover, rising fuel prices also imposes fiscal pressure on the government; in particular – price subsidies. The government of Nepal subsidies the retail prices of petroleum products to ensure end consumers can afford it. However, with exorbitant fuel prices, providing fuel subsidies can turn into a huge challenge; ultimately impacting the end consumers purchasing capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">MCC Nepal Compact and the Nepali economy-</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ruling alliance, on 27 February 2022 voted to pass the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact in the House of Representative (HoR). The compact was passed after the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) – the three partners in the Deuba government agreed to vote in favor of the compact with an interpretative declaration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal is soon expected to attain energy surplus due to completion of a number of hydropower plants. As of mid-January 2022, the country’s installed capacity has crossed 2,000 megawatts and investments by the general public on private power plants has reached Nrs. 215 billion. Moreover, a report titled ‘Economic Benefits from Nepal-India Electricity Trade’ has revealed that Nepal stands a chance of generating revenue worth Nrs. 310 billion per annum by 2030 by trading electricity with India. However, the country lags required infrastructure needed for cross-border electricity trade. Considering this, Nepal can greatly benefit from construction of a 315 kilometers double circuit 400kV transmission line as envisioned in the MCC Compact. With all five segments of the transmission line – New Butwal-India, New Butwal-New Damauli, New Damauli-Ratmate, Ratemate-Hetauda, and Hetauda-Lapsephedi – providing link for power projects to the national grid; both cross-border electricity trade and reliability of power supply are anticipated to enhance under the MCC compact. Similarly, high cost of transportation, weak logistics, insufficient road networks and low capital on transport has been plaguing Nepal’s road system. The MCC compact aims to increase funds for road maintenance, rehabilitate 300 kilometers of roads and create strategic road networks. With this, the country can profit significantly in terms of domestic and cross-border mobility for both commodities and passengers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, international assistance doesn’t automatically usher development, reduce poverty or lessen inequality. The electricity produced under MCC is not for local consumption but for cross-border trade. Thus, direct benefits to the local economy seems unattainable under the compact. Likewise, the possibility of lucrative procurement contracts and employment opportunities under road development projects must also be assessed before the projects are implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Government revises national budget during mid-term review-</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on 10 February 2022 revised the government’s annual plan of revenue and expenditure by 5.3 percent.

While the Deuba government has blamed political instability, late announcement of the substitution bill and the third wave of the pandemic for the budget cut; a closer look into budget planning and formulation reveals that populist policies and incompetent development strategies has led to the recent revision. This in turn has impacted the implementation and completion of remaining projects and programmes within the current fiscal. Moreover, frequent changes and revisions are also projected to affect the country’s capital/development expenditure. Capital expenditure has always been low in Nepal. Looking at the figures for the current fiscal, the Deuba government has only spent 16 percent of its capital expenditure on development activities.

The provincial government spent most of the time in power-sharing, mainly during the 4th year. During this, 12 chief ministers have been appointed in seven provinces. In 2020 and 21, the provincial leaders had been busy with decision related to power-sharing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExcept for Madhes and Sudurpaschim Province, chief ministers of two provinces—Province 1 and Bagmati have been changed three CMs each while Provinces Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali have changed two CMs each. For example, in Province 1, Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) leader Sher Dhan Rai became CM on February 14, 2018, and on August 16, 2021, Bhim Acharya replaced CM Rai. CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US) leader Rajendra Rai is now CM of Province 1. Similarly, in Bagmati, CPN-UML leader Dormani Poudel became CM on February 11, 2018, and Asta Laxmi Shakya replaced Poudel on August 18, 2021. CPN-US leader Rajendra Pandey is now CM of Bagmati.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, Kul Prasad KC of Gandaki, Krishan Chandra Nepal of Lumbini, and Jeevan Bahadur Shahi of Karnali Province replaced Gandaki CM Prithvi Subba Gurung, Lumbini CM Shankar Pokharel, and Karnali CM Mahendra Bahadur Shahi, respectively. Two CMs—Lalbabu Raut and Trilochan Bhatt, who are continuing as CMs so far but had to take a vote of confidence after the ruling party split.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilar to the politics at the federal level, all seven provincial governments experienced instability. In the first three years, they appeared stable and were able to formulate the acts. However, when KP Oli dissolved the federal parliament twice, the Maoist Center and Madhav Kumar Nepal withdrew from the UML. As a result, the CPN-UML-Oli-led government lost all provinces, including the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Formation of Acts</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost seven provincial governments have succeeded in the forming of necessary acts. Out of seven, Lumbini Province has passed 67 acts, the highest compared to the other provinces, while Karnali and Sudurpaschim Province have passed 36 acts each. Similarly, Madhes Province has passed 43 acts so far. While Bagmati government has passed 62 acts. Similarly, the Gandaki Provincial Assembly has passed 50 acts and the Lumbini Province has passed a total of 67 acts out of a total of 74 registered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite these acts, the provincial governments have been unable to implemented them due to a lack of coordination with the federal government. Recently, on February 8, Bharat Shah, Minister for Internal Affairs and Communication of Madhes Province, filed a resolution proposal in the Provincial Assembly for the implementation of the Provincial Police Act after the federal government showed carelessness in the implementation of the act.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Different Presentation of Madhes</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the seven provinces, Madhes Province has played an isolated role when compared to the other provinces. For instance, Madhes Province has filed six writs against the central government at the Supreme Court for interfering in the provincial government’s jurisdiction. While the remaining six provinces have not raised any questions with the federal government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, the selection of a provincial name is also different from the other provinces. While other provinces have derived their provincial names from rivers such as Bagmati, Gandaki, and Karnali, the Madhes Province government has chosen an identity-based name for the province.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Conclusion</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Political instability has become a major crisis in the functioning and performing of provincial government due to the centralized mindset of bureaucrats and politicians. The frequent changes in the provincial chief ministers are also because of instability at the federal level. The provincial government’s tenure is set to end in February 2023.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1670826062_MD-Morang-CMRai-scaled.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-02-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 18:06:02', '2022-12-12 18:06:02'),

The ratification was made possible after two partners of the ruling coalition, once vehement critics of the compact, agreed to vote in favor. The Compact, signed in September 2015, had been lingering in the parliament since July 2019.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLeaders of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda and the CPN (Unified Socialist) party led by Madhav Kumar Nepal were some of the fiercest and vocal critics of the MCC compact. From early in the month, Prachanda and Nepal’s primary strategy was to protect the ruling coalition despite their opposition to the MCC. Because of this, the two leaders opposed the idea of discussing the MCC in the parliament. After Deuba issued a deadline to his coalition partners to make a decision on February 26, both the leaders prioritized saving the ruling coalition over obstruction of the MCC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe self-imposed deadline of February 28 played a major role in forcing political parties to take a decision about the MCC Compact. Information about the self-imposed deadline was revealed when the letter written by Prachanda and PM Deuba to the MCC became public. In the letter, Prachanda and PM Deuba had asked for “four-five months” time to create an environment for the agreement’s ratification. Another major factor that forced a decision was the perceived US pressure. After US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu’s conversation with political leaders, politicians were worried about the possibility of the US government reviewing bilateral relations, creating pressure on parties to decide in favor of MCC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe MCC episode and the politics surrounding its ratification highlight several trends and implications for Nepali politics and international relations. One, being a part of the government has significant implications for electoral results and political parties are willing to sacrifice their values and ideals in the face of electoral reality. This fact shows the need for further electoral and political reforms to lessen the misuse of state’s power and resources for electoral benefits. Two, Deuba has achieved a political victory in managing to push through the MCC Compact and build credibility among western countries. However, the relationship between the Nepali Congress and China is likely to continue to falter. Three, Prachanda is likely to face considerable challenges in balancing trusted relationships with western powers as well as China. After the ratification of the MCC, Prachanda cast his move to support MCC as borne out of political compulsion—in order to protect the constitution and the ruling coalition. Four, during the debate over MCC, moves were afoot about rebuilding a leftist coalition by bringing together the three splintered groups led by Prachanda, Madhav Kumar Nepal and K P Oli. The effort is likely to continue in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, most importantly, the MCC episode highlights the role of other hidden factors including foreign powers, the motives and driving factors behind propaganda and disinformation, and the nature of Nepali public psyche, which can be easily manipulated by malafide actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Impeachment motion against Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepali Congress, Maoist Center, and CPN (Unified Socialist) filed an impeachment motion against Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana on February 13; 98 lawmakers signed the motion. Chief Justice Rana was suspended and the senior most justice, Deepak Kumar Karki, took over reins as the acting Chief Justice. The move has pitted the CPN UML against the ruling coalition. However, discussions on the impeachment motion have been held up due to excessive focus on MCC Compact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUML collecting its lawmakers’ signatures on six different blank papers roused speculations that it could file impeachment motions against the other justices as a response to the ruling alliance’s motion against Rana. These lawmakers were on the Constitutional Bench led by Rana which impeached KP Oli as Prime Minister and appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe UML believes that the veiled intention of impeachment of Rana is to sabotage the upcoming local level elections scheduled for May 13. CPN (Unified Socialist) and Maoist Center have been against holding local level elections in May, and are advocating for parliamentary elections in April-May.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe allegations against Cholendra Shumshere Rana range from corruption and misgovernance of the judiciary to seeking a share in the functioning of the executive. UML’s counter impeachment moves are primarily driven by a motive for revenge, but could end up affecting the impartiality and functioning of the Supreme Court. In particular, the four justices under threat from UML have given relatively clean and important verdicts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Loktantrik Samajbadi Party splinters</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>OnFebruary 22, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party’s (LSP) executive committee member Brikhesh Chandra Lal, leader Bijay Kumar Singh, and more than 100 supporters stated that they had withdrawn support for the LSP and decided to join the earlier Terai Madhesh Loktantrik Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe split, among others, was a result of disagreements between Chairman Manahtha Thakur and other leaders of the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. Members of the LSP had been expressing discontent with the “unilateral” and “authoritarian” working style of Chairman Mahantha Thakur.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMadhes-based parties have a history of mergers and splits. They had managed to gather together under the umbrella of Janata Samjabadi Party (JSP) in April 2020, which was led by co-chairs Upendra Yadav and Mahantha Thakur. The JSP split on July 26, 2021 after the two leaders clashed over whether to join the then government led by PM Oli. Thakur formed a separate party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party after the Election Commission recognized Yadav as the legitimate heir of the JSP.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Ajaya Bhadra Khanal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670826670_RoshanSapkota_KTM_RSS_31_2-2048x1782.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-04-11', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 18:16:10', '2022-12-12 18:16:10');

Macroeconomic indicators painted a gloomy picture of the national economy, owing chiefly to low remittance earnings, widening trade deficit and rising liquidity crunch.

The government also projected a growth rate of 6.5 percent and a per capita disposable income of Nrs. 180,279 (USD 1,486). However, on 12 July, 2021, the Supreme Court issued a verdict, which stripped Prime Minister Oli of his duties and responsibilities and appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba (leader of the opposition party) as the new prime minister. Following the change in government, the new finance minister- Janardan Sharma presented a white paper on 10 August, 2021 depicting a bleak situation of the national economy. Similarly, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) on 13 August 2021, unveiled its monetary policy with major emphasis on helping enterprises and individuals impacted by the pandemic by extending deadline for loan payment. Lastly, Minister Sharma introduced a substitution bill on 10 September, 2021, replacing the previous ordinance budget with a new one of Nrs. 1.623 trillion (USD 13.86 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For most of it, the ordinance budget (presented by the Oli administration) was largely aimed at expanding the voter base by the government for the then upcoming November elections. The budget had strategically allowed for an increment in social security and salary hike to please certain sections of the society. The growth target of 6.5 percent too was vaguely ambitious for a country fighting through its brutal second wave of Covid-19 pandemic; accurately reflecting a government guided by unrealistic assumptions and expectations. Considering this, the white paper (presented by the Deuba administration) was a befitting reply to the ordinance budget which was deeply concentrated in approving policies and programmes that suited the CPN-UML government. The paper not only discredited the formulation, finalization and implementation of national policies and programmes by the Oli government but also made public the practice of data manipulation by them; further raising questions regarding their credibility in pursuing clear policies. Similarly, the substitution bill (which replaced the ordinance budget) was more realistic as it focused on policies of transforming the economy from the current import-based model to an income-oriented one alongside addressing the ballooning trade deficit. Yet it too failed in downsizing the public and domestic debt of the country in addition to exerting immense pressure on the collection of revenue without clear state mechanism to do the same. Moreover, the assumptions made in the monetary policy (which was unveiled before the tabling of the substitution bill) remained largely unguided in its projection and assumptions; mirroring the lack of communication and coordination between NRB and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and hampering the implementation of merits/provisions as stipulated in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Dilemma in Agricultural Sector<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContext</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The year started off with the Supreme Court issuing an interim order to sugar mills to settle outstanding payments to sugarcane farmers within January 2021. The decision came as a relief to the sugarcane farmers who were demanding for their payment from sugar mills including- Shree Ram, Lumbini, Indira and Annapurna Sugar Mill. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies (MoICS), sugar mills and sugarcane farmers also reached a five-point agreement on 03 January, 2021, mandating sugar mills to make their final payment; however, farmers are yet to receive payment worth Nrs. 410 million (USD 3.38 million) and have continued with their protest throughout the year. Likewise, MoICS’s decision to allow FDI in Nepal’s agricultural sector too was heavily criticized and objected by relevant stakeholders. According to the decision, FDI was allowed in livestock farming, fisheries, bee farming, vegetables and fruits farming, oil, pulses and dairy industry under the condition that they export 75 percent of their total output. However, strong objection was displayed by agro-industries citing the government’s vested interest in introducing the new FDI bill. Furthermore, the devastating October rainfall destroyed agricultural crops (in particular paddy) worth Nrs. 8.26 billion (USD 68.80 million) across the country alongside inflicting immense loss upon livestock and food stored by farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sugarcane is cultivated across more than forty districts of Nepal and engages around 0.1 million farmers; however, sugarcane industries have consistently escaped from making payments to sugarcane farmers. While an agreement was reached between the three parties at the beginning of the year, the government’s failure in binding sugar mills through legal frameworks and delay in announcement of the Minimum Procurement Price (MPP) has risked farmers of postharvest loss, compelling them to sell the product (sugarcane) at below market prices. Likewise, the government amended the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA) 1992 this January allowing FDI in the agriculture sector. However, the move received heavy backlash from agro entrepreneurs fearing not being able to compete with multinational companies in terms of technology, investment and market access. While the bill (in earnest) is an outcome of strong political lobbying; allowing FDI in agriculture can ultimately enhance the ability of agro-industries in exploring global markers, attracting more investment (breaking the current cycle of low investment) and harvest of sub-standard agro-produce. However, the government has to be cautious that incidence of land grabbing (alienation of small scale and indigenous farmers from their land), alteration in agricultural practices (change in livelihood and food prices) and FDI’s impact on land use patterns (change in gender and social participation in agriculture) are averted. Lastly, the unusual October rainfall accurately portrayed the government’s priorities regarding the agricultural sector. Even with warnings and cautions from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), concerned authorities remained lax in their approach and preparation regarding the heavy rainfall; rendering paddy farmers with immense harvest destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Concerning Economic Landscape<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContext</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) published several reports including- the Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation and Economic Surveys over the year, revealing an alarming state of the Nepali economy. Out of the macroeconomic indicators, rising liquidity crunch, widening trade deficit and reducing remittance earnings were severe. While the central monetary authority injected credit into the financial system several times; banks and financial institutions (BFIs) (as of November 2021) are left with only Nrs. 55 billion (USD 455 million) to be enjoyed throughout the current fiscal. Similarly, with growing population and stagnant domestic production, the country’s dependency on food imports reached a new high, with the country importing staples worth Nrs. 3.23 trillion (USD 2.67 trillion) as of mid-July 2021. Likewise, merchandise imports of Nrs. 650.29 billion (USD 5.38 billion) as compared to merchandise exports of Nrs. 82.12 billion (USD 679 million) (as of mid-November 2021) too widened the trade deficit by 56.8 percent. Looking at the data for foreign direct investment (FDI), a considerable gap between approved FDI and actual FDI inflows was also noticed in Nepal. According to Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), actual FDI inflows stands at only 30 percent to 40 percent of approved FDI. Furthermore, the impacts imposed by the pandemic drastically reduced remittance earnings for four straight months of the current fiscal. As of latest data, remittance earning has shrunk by 7.5 percent to reach Nrs. 312.42 billion (USD 2.58 billion). This is unsettling for an economy where remittance accounts for 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Lastly, hotels, restaurants, travel and tourism sectors (for the second year), registered the lowest growth rate owing due to the government’s weak response and recovery policies with regards to Covid-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s economic indicators have been ominous for quite some years now, however, in the recent fiscal, it has been more alarming. For an economy highly dependent on remittance, the fall in foreign earnings has severely impacted the nation’s ability to pay its import bills and has widened its trade deficit. Moreover, with the country chiefly exporting products like refined palm and soybean oil (products that aren’t produced domestically), the asymmetry between imports and exports (as of November 2021) has further soared to Nrs. 83.4 billion (USD 690 million). Similarly, the difference between approved FDI and actual FDI inflows has delayed the implementation of anticipated projects. The soft economic embargo along Nepal’s northern transit points (since January 2020) has resulted in immense loss to local and national businessmen, who have been paying exorbitant price for trading goods via Indian ports. Likewise, the liquidity volatility in the financial market has chronically impacted the economy. With a meager capital spending of 4.53 percent (as of November 2021), cash released by the treasury in the economy has been below the expected average. Similarly, the recent asymmetry in bank deposits and bank loans has made it more difficult for the central bank in managing monetary authority. Lastly, slow vaccination drive, travel restrictions and prolonged recession in the travel and hospitality business has heavily impacted the sector. With 17 percent of hotels across the country shut (including- Hotel Annapurna and Shangri La) and fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, the country’s tourism infrastructure has severely collapsed; with little signs of improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Share Market and its Anomalies<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContext</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) tightening on share collateral, an impending liquidity crisis and the revival of alternative investment options post lifting of lockdown measures has contributed towards a sharp decline in Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE). Moreover, the market was also plagued by a series of controversies including insider trading which resulted in the resignation of CEO of NEPSE, an investigation into the chief of SEBON (Securities Board of Nepal) and a probe for delayed disclosure of key financial details of 51 high risk companies; ultimately reducing traders and customers confidence regarding the market and their investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the tightening of stock pledges by NRB definitely contributed towards the market’s decline; risky investments made by investors on hydropower projects, development banks and financial institutions based on market rumors rather than realistic predictions further pulled down the market. Moreover, involvement of top-level officials (from NEPSE and SEBON) in insider trading raised ethical questions regarding the functioning of the regulatory bodies; crushing investors and trader’s faith in them. Considering this, NRB needs to reconsider its policies and amend its restrictions on pledging one’s own assets for trading. Similarly, investors too need to adopt careful share-trading practices. Furthermore, incidents of insider trading also must be dealt with strict prosecution to prevent such anomalies and events in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outlook for the Year Ahead</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2021 Update, Nepal’s economy is anticipated to grow by 4.1 percent (at market prices) in the upcoming year 2022. This growth is largely anticipated to be driven by the ongoing vaccination drive and increased agricultural and industrial output. However, paddy plantation is predicted to be heavily impacted by future natural hazards including erratic monsoon and floods. Similarly, with weak domestic production, imports are expected to surge more than exports, further adding to asymmetry in balance of payments. Likewise, with forecast of future pandemic waves (owing to new variants of Covid-19) economic sectors including- tourism, construction and manufacturing is anticipated to record weak performance. Remittance earnings, FDI inflows and foreign currency reserves too is expected to fall. Considering this, the government’s fiscal and monetary policy must bring in concrete refinancing facilities and investment policies to assist the economy in its growth target. Moreover, recovery plan for banking and financial sector (with regards to the current liquidity crisis) must also be prioritized.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670827670_RoS-KTM-Kavre-FinanceMinisterSharmaa-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-03', '2022-03-09', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 18:32:50', '2022-12-16 19:42:47'),

Contrary to the plan, the number of fully vaccinated people per day increased by a meagre 0.3 percent. According to health experts, bureaucratic hassles have led to slowing down of the vaccination pace. Citizenship certificate is mandatory to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Consequently, Stateless people may be excluded from vaccination programs. In the context of Nepal, despite mechanisms for compulsory and free vaccination, certain groups encounter challenges on the ground due to the lack of citizenship documents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe intended purpose of the citizenship card is to keep track of those who have been vaccinated. But, given that millions of people in Nepal lack proof of legal identity, the imposition of this condition may jeopardize the efficacy of the vaccination campaign thereby making the country susceptible to Covid-19. It can therefore be argued that for the vaccination campaign to be effective, vaccination programs need to be inclusive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, the Ministry of Home Affairs on 13 January issued an order to make vaccination certificates mandatory to use public amenities and access to government services, effective from January 21. It may be argued that the decision was made without keeping in mind the ground situation. For an instant, the issue of “digital divide”, where not every household in the country has access to internet facilities or digital applications. How will an illiterate laborer get electronic vaccination registered for himself/herself? Has the government established a community center in rural areas where a person can get registered for a vaccination certificate without any hassle? If so, is it effective? These are some major questions unanswered so far from the fine print of the policy text.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, in the country where only 41.6% (as of 27 Jan 2021) of population is vaccinated, the decision to show vaccination certificate to avail services is discriminatory against those who are not vaccinated due to adequacy of the state mechanism which may include shortage of syringes; logistical-confusion; shortage of vaccines. People from Upper Dolpa are deprived of public services including vaccines due to heavy snowfall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnderstanding the gravity of the situation, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked the government not to deprive anyone of service if they cannot produce the certificate. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has urged the government to provide a hassle-free vaccination service and access to basic medicines. But the NHRC is silent on the issue of persons encountering challenges to get vaccination due to the lack of citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Dereliction of Duties</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Ruby Khan’s arduous battle for justice to end impunity for violence against women</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The protest which was launched by Ruby Khan along with 13 other protesters from Nepalgunj in the month of September 2021, finally concluded on 4 January 2022. The protesters had to launch repeated rounds of protests as the government was unsuccessful in performing the promises stipulated in the first agreement signed on 19 October 2021.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the first agreement, a six- member investigation committee, led by the joint secretary of the Home Ministry, was formed to investigate the case of the suspicious death of Nakunni Dhobi and disappearance of Nirmala Kurmi and submit an investigation report within a week. While the case of Nakuni Dhobi is ongoing at Banke District Court, it has been alleged that the government failed to diligently investigate the case of Nirmala Kurmi. The police arrested seven accused on the charge of abducting and killing Nirmala Kurmi, but never arrested the prime suspect- Badshah Kurmi, a Nepali Congress leader; contesting for Banke district president. Unsatisfied with the investigation, the protesters demanded that the government send a team from the Central Investigative Bureau (CIB) to investigate the case of Nirmala Kurmi.Finally on 4th January, a second agreement was signed, where after the home ministry gave orders to the police headquarters to send the CIB team to further investigate the case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite several pieces of evidence against Badshah Kurmi, it appears that his political affiliation has fetched him apparent impunity in the case. A pervasive culture of impunity and accountability for abuses remains a serious concern undermining human rights in Nepal. This was one of the serious issues raised by the International Human Rights bodies in their 2021 annual report.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Excessively long delays in Rape Trails</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A rape case of a 14 year old girl which was registered in the district court on 22 May, 2019, has been postponed 17 times. The district judges: Binod Khatiwada, Krishnamurari Shivakoti and Bhishmaraj Prasaihave been adjourning the hearing despite the order from the High Court of Janakpur to end rape case through ‘fast track’. Victim’s father is apprehensive that prolonged trial of rape will weakened the case resulting in an acquittal of accuse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExcessively long delays in criminal trial cases could result in grave miscarriage of justice thereby violating the victim’s fundamental right to live with dignity and integrity. Considering the vulnerability of women and child victims of rape and sexual violence, special and extensive rules are required to achieve effective justice.The time has come to question the administration as to why and when the fast track process for rape cases would be implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Gongabu gang-rape: Nine accused sent to Judicial Custody.</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On the evening of 28 December 2021, a 34-year-old woman from Surkhet, who came to the capital city in search of employment was gang-raped at Kathmandu’s New Bus Park. According to the victim’s statement, she was raped at three different hotels at Gongabu by 10 men from the evening of 28 December to the next day. The police on 29 December 2022, arrested nine people from different parts of Kathmandu based on the CCTV footage. However, the person who promised to give her a job is still absconding. According to the police, the absconding person may have brought the victim into the contact of nine people. Among the arrested are: Hikmat Nepali, Ratan Nepali, Suresh Sejwal, Deepak Nepali, Shivahari Budha, Yuvraj Baduwal, Hast Nepali, Chandra Saud and Gopal Shirish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn 26 January 2022, a single-judge bench of Kathmandu District Court led by Judge Ram Chandra Poudel issued an order to remand the nine accused to the judicial custody. However, the three hotel operators who were also made co-defendants in the present case were released on bail of Nrs. 3,00,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">National Census 2078 BS (2021)</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) under the National Planning Commission published the preliminary results of the National Census-2078 BS (2021) on 26 January. The population of Nepal has reached 29.91 million 192 thousand 480 (up by 2.6 million since 2011). Of which 14 million 901 thousand 169 (51.04%) are women and 14 million 291 thousand 311 (48.96%) are men. The gender ratio (the number of males per 100 females) is 95.91.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPopulation growth rate is 0.93% (down from 1.35%) which is the lowest in the last 80 years. Decrease in the birth rate and out-migration has been viewed as the reason behind low population growth rate. However, Nepal’s out-migrated population is not as large considering the fact that ten years ago, a total of 1,921,494 people were living abroad most of the time and at present it is 2,169,478.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nModern education has made people look at life differently which has led to accelerated decline in birth rate. Nevertheless, declining birth rates is a matter of concern for the nation because it brings about a tilt in the demographic dividend which works to the detriment of the country’s economic growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Criticism</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics have raised their doubts over the census results. The data is challenged by some based on the fact that a year and a half ago the Central Statistics Office had made public the estimated details of Nepal’s population exceeding 30 million. On 26 June 2020, the population clock of the department showed that the population of Nepal was 30 million 630 thousand and 4. Furthermore, the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA), a common organization of Nepalis around the world, has been claiming that 8 million Nepalis are living abroad contrary to government results which shows 2,169,478. Questions have been raised regarding the credibility of the census and if the census was carried out in a scientific manner. Despite the allegations, the statistics department has stated that the data collection is accurate and factual.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Geography Wise Population</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Madhes at present accommodates 20.99 percent of the country’s total population. According to experts, uncontrolled migration could lead to series sociological, economic and political consequences in Madhes: They have cited the following consequences: (i) confrontation between the migrant population and the local residents; (ii) loss of farmland which may impact the country’s food security; (iii) rise in population may increase political representation of the Tarai which may lead to a decrease in the number of electoral constituencies in the hilly region and reduce political representations in the legislative bodies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe experts have also listed positive aspects of migration to Tarai. Hill population shifts to the Tarai may change the existing mindset of discrimination against the residents of Tarai. If a good political culture develops, the intermingling of hill people in the Terai can lead to positive political results.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the positive and negative aspects of migration, all three levels of Governments are equally accountable for implementation, development and income generation plans in order to facilitate a habitable environment for the people of Tarai, and hilly and mountainous areas.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1670829084_SM_Jaleshower-202201201155331-2048x853.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-01', '2022-02-24', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 18:56:24', '2022-12-12 18:56:24'),

Finally, the fertilizer crisis has been worsening which can have serious implications for the food security in the following months.

Following the criticism, the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) formed a committee to further investigate the case. The report highlighted that the committee had not clearly demarcated the area which opened the door for Batas Organization to use more land. Another case involving the Batas Organization regarding the construction of a hotel in Pashupati Maitri Dharmasala has also come in highlight for the same reasons. In a separate case, CIAA has launched an investigation on the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation for the possible embezzlement of funds for the construction of Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium. All these high-profile cases have surfaced while the PM, in his address speech to the country highlighted that the government has adopted zero corruption policy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Terziev &amp; Petkov (2018), corruption negatively impacts the national security as it disrupts the social environment, the economic development, and the normal functioning of the state. A report from Transparency International reiterates that one of the major causes of corruption is relaxed procurement processes. In the case involving Batas Organization, serious questions must be asked of the authorities about the legal procedure to offer public assets to the private organization, as no transparency was offered. Similarly, Dhurmus-Suntali had been receiving donations from NRNs, and different government bodies, but no transparency was offered on how these donations were utilized. The prevalence of such corruption cases can also be attested to the cronyism in politics. The cahootism between the authorities and certain businessmen to land lucrative contracts disrupts the social, economic, and political fabric of the country by eroding the rule of law. The case of Agricultural Inputs Company (AIC) awarding the contract to supply chemical fertilizer to a company without competitive bidding procedure through which substandard fertilizers were imported is an example of such growing cronyism in politics. Although the National Security Policy of Nepal has emphasized on the control of corruption by increasing accountability, it still ranks 117th among 180 countries in the Corruption Perception Index. Thus, the government must focus on a transparent contracting process which helps to avoid foul play, identify conflict of interests, and ensures fair pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Covid-19: Omicron trends in South Africa encouraging for Nepal?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal reported a total of 10, 258 cases of Covid-19 on January 18, the highest number of single day cases to date. However, there is no exact data on the Covid-19 variant breakdown. To address this issue, the authorities have made vaccination cards mandatory to enter public places like bars and restaurants, and board flights. PM Deuba in his address speech has shared the government’s plans to vaccinate 100 percent of the eligible population by Chaitra (Mid-April). Amidst the growing cases, the news of depleting Vero Cell vaccine stocks could deprive people from second dose and booster shots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince omicron variants have proven to be milder in comparison to the previous variants, hospitalization rates have been low. Analyzing the data and trends of South Africa where the first case of omicron was detected, gives a positive picture for other countries. The omicron wave which started in November hit its peak in mid-December. Although it was expected that the 90% of the population would get infected in this wave, the numbers infected remained well below the threshold. Scientists have speculated that South Africa’s younger population and herd immunity could be the two main reasons for this. Nepal also has predominantly younger population (median age being around 24 years old). On top of that, Nepal and South Africa both have fully vaccinated around 43% of its total population (as of 24 January). Although these data are encouraging, it is important to note that the situation for each country is different.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Worsening fertilizer crisis could lead to food security issues</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has indicated that the country is undergoing a chemical fertilizer crisis. One of the main reasons for this is the reluctance of China to export chemical fertilizers to Nepal. China issued a statement clarifying that it would halt the export of phosphates until mid-2022 to meet the internal demand. Similarly, due to the higher demands around the world, the price of fertilizers has soared. Although the government has increased NRs 12.71 billion to the already existing NRs 15 billion regular budget for the purchase of chemical fertilizers, it hasn’t been able to strike a deal with any foreign companies for the export. The fertilizer crisis has been a recurring issue every year which is also due to the duopoly of Salt Trading Limited and Agricultural Inputs Company Limited.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe unavailability of fertilizer will directly affect the crop production. Similarly, this will also drive the food prices which will especially impact the vulnerable communities that have already been impacted by the pandemic. To address this issue, Nepal has been planning to open a fertilizer plant. The Investment Board Nepal (IBN) has been looking into the prospect since 2015 and conducted a detailed feasibility study through an Indian firm. The report highlighted that the demand (which is comparatively low) doesn’t justify the huge production cost of establishing a plant. Furthermore, the production of fertilizer requires natural gas which needs to be imported either from India or Bangladesh. Although the plant can entirely run-on electricity, it is estimated to be even costlier. So, a more detailed analysis is required before starting the construction. Thus, the government must stockpile the fertilizers to meet the demand during shortages and should also consider gradually shifting towards organic fertilizers.</p>', NULL, 2811, NULL, NULL, 'Yunish Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670832256_RG-Bhaktapur-MeetingOmicronb.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-01', '2022-02-24', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 19:49:16', '2022-12-16 19:40:09');

The sub-committee’s role is to provide suggestions and assistance to the new foreign policy, which the Foreign Minister Narayan Khadka will devise. The sub-committee will also study all the issues from the organizational and structural shortcomings in foreign affairs and submit a report with recommendations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral committees have been formed with the same purpose in the past. However, the reports were never executed. This is because foreign policy of Nepal appears to shift with the change of government instead of being implemented on the basis of national consensus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal-India relations</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Prime Minister Deuba leading a 30-member delegation, was prepared for a four-day visit to India to attend the Vibrant Gujrat Summit. Deuba was the executive heads of one of the five nations that were invited. Deuba’s itinerary also included a bilateral meeting with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Both countries had laid the basis for PM’s visit by signing eight memorandums of understanding in various sectors such as importing chemical fertilizers, Kurtha- Jayanagar railway, and post-earth-quake reconstruction. However, the visit got canceled due to the postponement of the summit due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The prime minister would have received red carpet treatment in Delhi had the summit taken place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForeign Minister Narayan Khadka and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, also discussed bilateral issues like development projects and post-earthquake reconstruction over a telephone conversation. Further, maintaining party-to-party and personal relations, Arzu Rana Deuba, the wife of PM Deuba, met with Vijay Chauthaiwale, the Foreign Affairs Department Chief of India’s ruling Bhartiya Janata Party in Delhi on January 2. While Nepal-India relations appear to be smoothening on various diplomatic and symbolic fronts, pressing matters such as the border dispute between the two countries remain unresolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Border Dispute with India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The outstanding border disputes in Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura have again gained traction and triggered Nepal’s politicians and public. The Indian Prime Minister’s statement regarding expansion of route to China’s Mansarovar via Lipulekh in an election rally in Uttarakhand on December 30 may adversely impact the improving Nepal-India relations as the territory remains disputed without resolve. However, Nepal’s delayed response and nonchalance drew much flak from the public.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia unilaterally has been carrying out activities in the disputed territory while deferring with dialogue with Nepal. Furthermore, the Governor of the Indian State of Uttarakhand visited Nabhi, Kuti, and Gunji in the Kalapani area of Darchula without the Nepal government’s permission. The Rashtriya Janamorcha party expressed a stern objection over the Indian official’s visit without a permit. However, India has reiterated its previously held position on the matter stating, “India’s position on the border issues are well known, consistent, and unambiguous” on January 15.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government’s spokesperson stated that the Nepal government had requested the Indian government to halt unauthorized road construction/expansion into Nepal’s territory. However, this does not suffice. The government has failed to stimulate bilateral mechanisms that have remained non-operational for years. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s visit to India would have perhaps helped initiate the dialogue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe geographic proximity of Nepal and India and their multifaceted relationship may create misunderstanding and distrust in bilateral relations. Further, the Indian government’s failure to recognize Nepal’s sensitivity to certain issues and its passivity on them appears to be fueling misunderstandings and counterproductive responses in Nepal. Furthermore, due to the strong position taken by both sides in the issue of the Kalpani, Lipulekh, and Limipiyadhura, it may take multiple discussions to resolve the matter. Despite failed attempts, engaging in continuous diplomatic dialogues appears to be the only reasonable option.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal and China relations</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>China claims it deems Nepal as an imperative strategic partner. Its relationship with Nepal is based on peaceful coexistence, respect towards Nepal’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, friendly bilateral relations based on equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs. However, its actions speak otherwise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and China signed the Trade and Transit treaty protocol in 2019. Nevertheless, it has not come into force. Instead, the bilateral trade between the two countries has declined over the years, with Covid-19 being a convenient excuse. Traders and businesspersons protested the undeclared border blockade in Kerung and Tatopani checkpoints in Kathmandu on January 12. As per the customs office, only nine trucks from Kerung and 11 from Tatopani are allowed to enter Nepal on daily basis. Previously, 200 to 250 containers of goods entered Nepal daily. Earlier, there used to be correspondence with Chinese counterparts. However, it has halted since the Covid-19 crisis struck the country. The government stated that they had taken diplomatic initiatives to address this issue. However, there has been no improvement in the situation. The Chinese side has been heedless to the requests of Nepali businesspersons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the 1965 Vienna Convention on Transit and Trade of the Land-locked States, the landlocked Nepal is entitled to import goods from the international market with no interference and stoppage. Similarly, Article 125 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas, 1973 (UNCLOS) confers the right to access to and from sea and freedom of transit to all the landlocked nations. As China and Nepal are signatories of both the conventions, the undeclared border blockade impeding the import of goods infringes international laws. Both the countries are also members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and are bound by WTO laws, allowing them to trade with one another.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina has also been hesitant to send chemical fertilizers to Nepal in compliance with the agreement. China inducted a policy to limit exports of chemical fertilizer on the premise of “low production.” Due to the new policy, fertilizers have been stuck at many locations across China. Three hundred metric tons of compost are also stuck near the Tatopani border. Nepal’s Ministry of Agriculture had sent a diplomatic letter regarding the issue but has not received any response from China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, China has only been engaging politically in Nepal, recently. State-to- State bilateral engagements have tapered. A high-level officer at Home Ministry revealed that all infrastructure projects under BRI have been halted. Further, China has chosen to disregard the diplomatic notes sent by Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">The border dispute with China</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>China has again claimed that there is no border dispute with Nepal. Chinese Embassy’s Spokesperson Xiaolong stated that Nepal has no border issues with China. Amidst the unresolved border issue, China passed a Border law on October 23, 2021, which came into effect on January 1, 2022. The new law states that PLA shall strengthen the border defense to support economic and social development in border areas. It also states that China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are sacred and invaluable. Further, the law lays down a legal framework for border closure if needed. The law also allows China to encounter invasion, encroachment, and infiltration along with border areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new border law may affect the resolution of the border dispute between China and Nepal. The new law may act as a deterrent in resolving border disputes, adding additional pressure on Nepal making it more fearful of China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough the law, China seeks to transform border dispute into territorial dispute by assuming the right or allowing itself the discretion to bring anything under the sovereignty ambit. It is a strategy to strengthen China’s negotiating leverage to take a tougher stance in negotiations with Nepal. China’s unilateralism is reflected in the border law, a glaring illustration of power demonstration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, Nepal and China signed a border protocol on January 20, 1963. The protocol has details of the alignment of the boundary line. The protocol also allows Nepali nationals and Chinese nationals to cross border up to 20 KMs for trade purpose. Generally, bilateral agreements and multilateral agreements supersede domestic laws. However, China has passed domestic legislation and is asking other states to respect it. This is an approach to make its creeping expansionism lawful. It has proved that bilateral agreements and protocols hold value only if they serve China’s interest.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1670832888_Pro_Ktm_gyanendrakhadka11.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-01', '2022-02-24', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 19:59:48', '2022-12-12 19:59:48'),

However, the incessant rise in imports does not bode well for the Nepali economy which is already deep in its own internal economic crisis – a rising liquidity crunch. While spending more money on imports does signal growing economic and business activities, it severely depletes foreign exchange reserves that an economy keeps. Moreover, spending a trillion rupees in just six months is alarming for a small nation which previously recorded such figure after the completion of an entire fiscal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a direct consequence of the bloated imports bill, Nepal’s foreign exchange reserve has reduced by 14.7 percent during the first five months of the current fiscal. As of present, forex is left for only 6.8 more months, contrary to NRB’s target of maintaining such reserves to continue imports for 7 more months. Similarly, according to the ‘Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation’ published by NRB, over 1/4th of remittance received by the economy was spent in making import payment. This has left the economy with little money to be channeled into other productive sectors. Moreover, with weak tourist arrival; tourism income which reduced by 70 percent (in 2020/21) is further anticipated to fall due to future impact inflicted by the Omicron wave. In this scenario, Nepal’s exorbitant expenditure on foreign goods and commodities poses huge repercussions on the country’s revenues. This also signals the nation’s need for an emergency credit facility, which shall be hard for the country to avail amidst its ongoing liquidity crisis. Furthermore, the nation could also expect a financial default, something that Turkey is currently facing due to rapidly reducing foreign earnings; if it does not impose a ceiling on its imports and lessen the rising pressure on its foreign exchange reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Ministry of Industry, SEBON and NEPSE yet to get their heads-</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sher Bahadur Deuba administration has failed in appointing a Minister at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies (MoICS), six months into their tenure. Following the controversial exit of Gajendra Hamal (who resigned three days after his appointment by Prime Minister Deuba), the position has remained vacant since the previous incumbent, Lekh Raj Bhatta left office in May 2021. Similarly, the Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) too are operating without their respective chairperson. Both the previous heads, Bhishma Raj Dhungana and Chandra Singh Saud were sacked by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on grounds of illegal shares ownership of Sarbottam Cement in October 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The repeated delay in appointment of Minister for Industry and Commerce and chairpersons of SEBON and NEPSE has highlighted the presence of heavy politicization, loud disagreements and lack of coordination among ministries and government institutions in appointing key officials. It also shows the government’s lack lustre approach towards industrial and financial development especially considering how badly the economy is operating post the second Covid-19 wave. The absence of the Minister for Industry has left several bills including – The Business Credit Flow Work Procedure 2021 (which had promised to provide seed capital of up to Nrs. 2.5 million at an interest rate of 1 percent) in a limbo. This has been further intensified by the parliament’s failure in passing any bill due to obstruction as staged by CPN-UML post its reinstatement back in 2021. Similarly, the vacancy has also led to an exorbitant rise in market and shipping prices of goods and commodities, with traders setting prices favourable to their business and profit. Likewise, the delay in appointment of chairpersons at SEBON and NEPSE has highlighted the internal conflict between the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the Selection Committee (as formed by the Ministry of Finance) with regards to the ‘Working Procedure on Selection of SEBON and NEPSE Head’. The committee has accused Dr. Biswo Poudel of amending the ‘work procedure’ without prior consultations with MoF, further escalating the conflict of interest between bureaucracy and economic institutions particularly in terms of leadership, superiority and power. Such conflicts have time and again impeded several policies and plans targeted by the government; one could assume the current delay in selection of heads is a fine example of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">NOC announces bankruptcy, worsening inflation fear across the nation-</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The state-owned Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) on 22 January 2022 announced its bankruptcy, despite months of exorbitant price hike in petroleum fuels and other crude oil. NOC which has been on a price increase spree since 2014, announced its latest hike on 18 January 2022 following which petrol and diesel cost Nrs. 139 and Nrs. 122 per litre, respectively. However, despite the recent hike, NOC is reported to be operating under a loss of Nrs. 3.70 billion per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The current fuel crisis in Nepal clearly demonstrates the country’s ill guided policies and taxation system with regards to petroleum fuels. All this can be attributed to the directives brought in by the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli led government which commenced the trend of increasing fuel prices in the name of infrastructural development. In addition to infrastructural tax, the government has also imposed various additional taxes on per litre purchase of fuel, to be collected from end consumers. Inflation has a direct relation with fuel prices in Nepal. Hence, the current rising prices is expected to pose heavy repercussions on consumers who are already reeling under a worsening inflation crisis including a monthly consumer inflation rate of 7.11 percent, year-on-year. Moreover, with the country’s economic activities directly dependent oil for on transportation and logistics, increasing fuel inflation is also expected to hamper service industries, by increasing their cost of production. In this scenario, NOC’s repeated price hike is ought to push inflation to greater heights in days to come; making it costlier for consumers to avail fuel and other daily necessities.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1670835031_RS_KTM__D3A1275-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-01', '2022-02-24', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 20:35:31', '2022-12-12 20:35:31'),

Province 2 government had tried several times to collect the majority in the provincial assembly, but the lack of consensus among the parties failed to come up with a provincial name. However, this time, 80 provincial members out of 90 voted in favor of ‘Madhes’ while 78 votes were cast in favor of Janakpur as capital.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the vote, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, CPN-Maoist Centre, as well as the opposition, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LOSPA) jointly supported the naming of Madhes Province. Despite being the opposition party in Madhes Province, LOSPA has supported the ruling party’s main agenda of identity-based rights. While Nepal Congress party had proposed provincial name ‘Mithila-Bhojpura’, CPN-Unified Socialist party and main opposition CPN-UML had jointly proposed provincial name ‘Janaki.’ However, Province 2 was named Madhes by two-thirds after receiving enough support from the leaders of the main opposition—CPN-UML.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe naming of the province courted criticism as people argued that provincial names could not be retained based on identity. Province 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 had been named as Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim respectively, based on names of rivers and historical places. However, identity-based politics is one of the important aspects of Nepal’s federalism. The identity-based provincial name, Madhes Province represents the people’s identity, society, and culture which reflects the real practice of identity-based federalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Debate over the name of Madhes Province</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While most Madhesi people and political leaders have welcomed the name of the province, it has invited mixed reactions from opinion makers, social media, civil society, and political leaders. Madhes Province even declared a public holiday on January 18 to celebrate the naming of the province. According to analysts, Madhesis have accepted the provincial name as a partial achievement from Madhes movements. The Madhesi community had organized the Madhes movement in different stages (as the first, second, and third movements in 2007, 2008, and 2015 respectively) for better recognition and representation of their identity. Thus, Madhes-based political leaders have also accepted the becoming of Madhes Province as a by-product of the Madhes movement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne Madhes, One Pradesh (Ek Madhesh, Ek Pradesh) had been the agenda of Madhes-based political parties since the first Madhes Movement in 2007. However, the agenda had been abandoned due to interparty tension among Madhes based parties and leaders. Similarly, in 2015, the demand for ‘One Madhes Two Pradesh’ began to gain ground amidst protests against the newly promulgated constitution which resulted in the carving out of two provinces in Madhes—one from Jhapa to Parsa and another from Chitwan to Kanchanpur. Tharu people and leaders had also demanded a separate Tharuwan Province in western Nepal during the 2015 protests, and the Tikapur incident. However, Tharus still await their justice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile, some politicians from Madhes claim that the naming of the Madhes Province is an achievement in giving the sense of implementation of federalism. However, other Madhesi leaders say that the agenda of a Madhes movement was to have a province represent Madhesis of the 22 districts. They say that the fight for such a province shrunk 14 districts and then to only eight which caused greater damage politically and geographically.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Poor Capital Budget Expenditure</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has spent the lowest capital budget of 13.44 percent in past six months compared to the last three fiscal years. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance, Janardhan Sharma’s announcement to spend 10% capital budget in the first three months and then 10% each month at any cost triggered debates but the government failed to meet even half of its target. Despite Minister Sharma’s attempts to gather with other minsters several times for an effective budget implementation, the government has failed to spend capital budget due to delayed implementation, budget holidays, and political tension.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe budget implementation has also been affected by the delays in the formation of the provincial cabinets due to political instability. All seven provincial governments have been taking a long time for cabinet expansion due to government changes in the last two to three months. For instance, Karnali provincial government has not yet been able to expand the cabinet. Despite, Jeevan Bahadur Shahi being appointed as Chief Minister on November 3, 2021, Karnali Province is still depending on the centre for the cabinet expansion. Prior to his appointment, the position lay vacant for a long period of time which has also impacted the budget expenditure and effective governance. The lack of proper budget implementation harms development sectors, which requires the attention of the leaders, representatives, government, and other concerned bodies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has expressed concern over the growing corruption and irregularities in the country. The commission has received the highest number of corruption and irregularities-related complaints from the local government. In the fiscal year 2020-21, the commission had received 14,425 such complaints. The CIAA also claimed that most of the local level resources are mobilized by the consumer committees. Thus, pointing out that one of the major causes of increase in irregularities was from the consumer committees. Recently, a team of the CIAA raided Pipara Rural Municipality of Mahottari, from where the commission had received 32 complaints about irregularities. This is an example of a local level corruption. However similar corruption and irregularities are found in all tiers of the government, adversely affecting the economy of the country. Furthermore, lack of proper monitoring of staffs and local representatives’ is also a cause for rampant corruption.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1670835827_AKS_DHANUSA_JASAPA.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-01', '2022-02-24', NULL, '0', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 20:48:47', '2022-12-16 19:13:42'),

As per the former, local elections should be held by May this year, before the mandates of the local bodies expire. Since the Local Level Elections Act’s rules don’t not align with the constitutional provision, which the ruling alliance argues gives a leeway of six months to hold elections, the Deuba faction of Nepali Congress has proposed to amend the Act in order to make it align with the constitution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCPN (Unified Socialist) and Maoist Centre are in agreement with this decision. However, doing so is likely to push the elections past the April-May deadline and postpone elections by eight to twelve months, and CPN-UML, the main opposition party, and Shekhar Koirala faction of the Nepali Congress objects to postponement of elections. However, the Deuba faction argued that constitutional provisions should be given priority over the Local Level Elections Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The last local level elections took place in three phases on May 14, June 28, and September 18 of the year 2017. Article 215 (6) of the constitution mandates that terms of elected officials (chairman, vice-chairman, and ward chair-man) would be five years from the date of elections. Conversely, Section 3 of the Local Level Elections Act mandates that elections should be held within two months before the local bodies’ terms and mandates expire (which is on March 19). This would mean that officials elected in the June and September terms of 2017 elections would not be able to complete their five years. This may be a possible reason why certain parties would want elections to be delayed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCritics of the Deuba government have argued that Deuba has fallen under the influence of Dahal and Nepal in order to delay the local level elections. It is likely that Deuba fears Dahal will join hands with CPN (UML) to “form a broader left” alliance if he does not concur, as this had happened before in 2017 after the local elections’ first phase. Although the Local Level Elections Act clearly states that elections should be held by May this year, Deuba government leaders have cited constitutional provisions which give a margin of six months to hold the elections.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2002, Deuba had attempted to hold elections after dissolving the House, but he was excised from his post by the then King Gyanendra. This led to local level elections not being able to take place. Critics of the Deuba government have pointed out this event in history and remarked that this should not take place again and elections should be held promptly and that interpreting constitutional provisions to delay elections in favour of party interests is an attack on the rule of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">CPN (UML)’s continuation of house blockade and its implications</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On August 17, 2021, the UML had recommended that Speaker Agni Sapkota excise 14 of UML’s allegedly defective lawmakers from their posts, however, Sapkota refused to concur. Eventually, UML split into CPN (UML), and the new party registered on August 25, CPN (Unified Socialist). Since then, CPN (UML) has obstructed House proceedings claiming that Speaker Agni Sapkota conspired with the dissident UML members to split the party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsequently, the House has not been able to function effectively. Since the obstructions began, the House has only been able to endorse bills regarding the national budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Analysis</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CPN-UML has been demanding that Agni Sapkota and Sher Bahadur Deuba should hold meetings with KP Oli to resolve their differences. The party argues that the constitution was misinterpreted when the ordinance to facilitate party splits was passed, and that the current government is illegitimate. The party has criticized the ruling coalition on improper handling of Nepal’s economy, foreign relations, the Covid-19 outbreak, the MCC, among other issues and remarked that the three organs of the state are not functioning properly. Furthermore, the opposition party remarked that the ruling alliance hasn’t allowed the parliamentary practice to allow the main opposition to lead the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). On the other hand, the ruling coalition blames CPN (UML) for curtailing House functions through obstructions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first session of the reinstated House convened on March 7, 2021. Although 50 bills were pending, the House didn’t endorse any bills for 44 days. It is the first time in Nepal’s history that a House session ended without endorsing any bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is possible that CPN-UML is attempting to prove that the House is irrelevant in order to legitimize Oli’s dissolution moves of the House on December 20, 2020, and May 21, 2021 which were both overturned by the Supreme Court; Oli was eventually removed as prime minister.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn any case, CPN-UML’s obstruction of parliament and demanding in person meetings with the prime minister seem to be contradictory moves from CPN-UML. A party adhering to democratic standards should be willing to resolve conflict through legal measures rather than causing obstructions to governance. However, CPN-UML argues that it is to protest against (perceived) injustice from speaker Agni Sapkota.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">National assembly elections</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Context</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>National Assembly (upper house) elections took place on January 26.

From visiting the Pashupatinath temple and replacing a silver ornament with a much more expensive gold ornament with taxpayer money, to two weeks later, organizing a mass gathering of his faction of the NCP in front of the former royal palace, to declaring that the Hindu god Ram was born in Nepal, Oli’s public acts continued to escalate as he began losing political capital. More recently, the Maoist chairman Prachanda came under criticism for meeting with the polarizing Indian figure and yoga guru, Ramdev, who is also a Hindutva enthusiast. The optics of such events are difficult to ignore and appear to be attempts at garnering sympathy from the pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu constituency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPro-Hindu agenda has been gaining traction in Nepal, with some believing that a Hindu Nepal would also be a stepping stone for reinstating the monarchy. However, Nepal does not have to look far to see that the use of religion as political fodder can have dire consequences as the Hindutva push in Nepal is quite reminiscent of the Hindu extremism in India. Hindutva politics in Nepal’s southern neighbor India has promoted a form of intolerant majority rule that encourages discrimination and violence against the minorities. The hard-line attitude of the ruling party of India towards Muslims has undermined India’s reputation as a tolerant and secular democracy in the South Asian region and the world. The mob violence unleashed upon the Muslims in February of 2019 was a result of government representatives using violent rhetoric in the name of nationalism and majoritarianism. Furthermore, comments made by Tripura’s Chief Minister Biplav Dev on Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s alleged plans to ‘expand the party’s government in Nepal’ has also raised concerns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHindu nationalist ideas and organizations such as RSS, imported from across the border have already found legitimacy in Nepal further strengthened by the support of leaders like Kamal Thapa of the pro-Hindu and pro-monarchy Rastriya Prajatantra Party. However, the activities carried out by communist leaders such as Oli who are otherwise guided by leftist ideologies and secular principles, also appear to be appealing to electoral support from Nepal’s Hindu population. The politicization of religion has been legitimized due to its potential to garner voters. However, the state representative or party embracing a particular religion sanctions the politics of hatred and violates the principle of democratic republicanism. If the trends in Nepal’s southern neighbor is any indication, Hindutva politics is anti-minority, violent, undemocratic, and poses a threat to the secular fabric of Nepal. Although its implications have been limited to politics so far, possible security implications in the future cannot be ruled out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Politicization of MCC and Propaganda Warfare in Nepal</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The US-China relationship has entered a period of great uncertainty and instability as China has become more powerful and more assertive in the international arena. Similarly, China’s active role in the South Asian region has flared India’s security sensitivities. IPS as a strategy includes a military component, which aims to deter growing Chinese influence, also addressing India’s security concerns by way of The United States’ readiness in the area. While some argue that IPS and MCC are closely related as outlined in the U.S. National Security Strategy, others maintain that such claims are overblown and that Nepal would be losing out on one of the largest U.S. grants in recent history for the development of energy infrastructure and road maintenance in Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA sharp divide over the compact within the coalition government has added further complications to the ratification. Those in support of the compact argue that it is vital for the development of the country as it would create infrastructure, employment opportunities, and accelerate economic development of the country. Whereas, critics perceive MCC to be against the national interest of the country and argue that it overrides the Nepali constitution putting the United States in control of the implementation of the compact. The compact is currently under consideration in the Parliament. However, Nepal’s political parties and a large section of the public continue to be divided over the program, generating great controversy and forcing the government to put the program on hold. Foreign aid and the influence that come with it has remained a contested topic in geopolitically sensitive Nepal. Whether or not MCC is a part of the broader IPS strategy has taken center stage, triggering intense debates on the compact and if it undermines Nepal’s sovereignty and constitution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government of Nepal had sent a letter to MCC seeking clarification on dubious clauses in the compact. While the MCC response says Nepal is not a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy and describes itself as an independent U.S. foreign assistance agency, American officials have made contradicting statements on the matter in the past. For instance, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that MCC was in fact a part of IPS during Pradeep Gyawali’s visit in 2019. However, Vice President of MCC, Fatema Sumar, during her visit to Nepal, denied any military component being attached to MCC and maintained that MCC would enable access and support Nepal’s development goals by way of investment in energy and infrastructure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal hosted two top American officials in the past year with MCC’s Vice President Fatema Sumar’s visit to Nepal in early September and Donald Lu, assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs visit in November. Both visits came at a time where the United States and MCC have become hotly debated topics in Nepal’s political discourse. While Donald Lu’s visit was said to be a familiarization trip, Fatema Sumar’s visit garnered immense attention. She met with political leaders to discuss the opportunities provided by the compact and offered clarifications on issues linked with the MCC. She also dismissed doubts around MCC being a part of the Indo-Pacific strategy which would violate one of Nepal’s core foreign policy tenets of non-alignment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe United States Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC) had released a statement in September expressing that both MCC and Nepal had taken positive steps towards the ratification of the compact after MCC’s Vice President to Nepal in early September. However, MCC released another statement expressing dissatisfaction after the parliament session was prorogued on 29 October, obstructing the parliamentary ratification of the compact which has been pushed several times before. The statement read that such obstructions to the ratification of the compact further delays benefits to millions of Nepali households and that delays to ratification jeopardize the critical and timely support that the grant would provide. While the statement also said that the decision to move forward with the compact or not rests with Nepal, it also emphasized that the government of Nepal had made commitments confirming their ongoing support for the compact. Furthermore, Vice President of MCC Fatima Sumar also expressed that she was confident Nepal would endorse the USD 500-million MCC agreement in a display of American persistence on the ratification of the agreement. She also added that Nepal should not delay in ratifying the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) adding, “The country needs to ratify it.”, demonstrating growing American frustration with Nepal and mounting pressure on the current government. It is also a departure from previously used American strategies of persuasion or dissuasion to coercion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFatema also highlighted that her visit to Nepal was to provide clarity on misconceptions and false rhetoric against MCC, demonstrating that the public disinformation campaign in Nepal regarding MCC and American influence in the region has alarmed the United States. Her statement comes amidst reports alleging that China is lobbying against the MCC. “Since there has been a lot of misunderstanding, misperception and confusion on the MCC-funded project in Nepal, China has taken this misconception as an opportunity to provoke anti-MCC movement in the country”. Furthermore, American frustration is visible in Nepal as cooperation has been scaled down on various fronts over the past three years. Although Nepal and American development relationship is over 80 years old, such public disinformation campaigns and continued politicization may have adverse impact on development partnerships such as USAID, American support via the United Nations etc.Nepal is currently experiencing a propaganda warfare between two superpowers, namely, China and the United States wherein the Nepali media has been used to create certain narratives and counter narratives. Such developments can create security threats in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal Clear of Afghanistan Takeover Spillover Effects</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>President Joe Biden’s withdrawal of all U.S troops from Afghanistan in September not only marks the end of America’s longest fought war, but also removed Taliban’s most formidable hurdle in its takeover of Afghanistan. Various analysts anticipated that the move would create geopolitical impacts and shifts in the region with serious ramifications on regional peace and security as a whole. They also suggested spillover effects on Nepal in the form of a refugee crisis caused by the displacement of Afghans. However, over six months since the US pullout, there is a lack of potent indicators.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnalysts argued that the loosely regulated Indo-Nepal border would cause the flow of Afghan refugees into Nepal. However, Nepal has always looked towards India in the anticipation of a refugee crisis which would only occur if India allowed lapses in its security mechanisms. Other analysts also pointed out that the effects of the Taliban takeover can be observed in radicalization and fundamentalist activities. However, the lack of such activities demonstrates that Nepal has not directly experienced any spillover effects. Nonetheless, even in the absence of direct effects, Nepal needs to ramp up border security measures to avoid possible crisis given the loosely regulated border with India and a weak surveillance and security system not robust enough to combat terrorist forces on its own.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670838703_RoshanSapkota_KTM_RSS_31_2-2048x1782.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-02-09', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 21:36:43', '2022-12-16 19:13:30'),

Constitutional experts, advocates and civil right activists condemned the step, claiming it to be blatantly unconstitutional. The discontent groups – political parties, general public and civil society – came out in protest against PM KP Sharma Oli’s move and called upon him to “stop misuse of state machinery”. To disperse the agitating protesters, police used batons and water cannons, injuring, Narayan Wagle, Mohana Ansari and other human rights defenders. Journalist Narayan Wagle was arrested from outside the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar and released after four hours. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) urged the government to respect the citizens’ rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assemblies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Protest at Supreme Court</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana was accused of disturbing the separation of powers and compromising with the independence of the judiciary because of his relationship with the executive branch. Inclined to redeem the dignity and credibility of the judiciary, the justices and lawyers launched their protest on 25 October demanding reform in the judiciary. As a part of the protest, the Nepal Bar Associations decided to stop Rana from entering the Supreme Court. During the protest, lawyers sustained injury when police used force. The NHRC called on the police to avoid unnecessary force in peaceful protests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protests effected the hearings in the court, effecting people’s right to justice. Concerned with the judicial deadlock, the International Human Rights Organizations and the Chiefs of eight constitutional commissions of Nepal appealed to the parties in the dispute to find a solution to the deadlock through mutual dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Ruby Khan and her March to Justice</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rights activist Ruby Khan, who was protesting against impunity for violence against women, was falsely charged with “polygamy” because she had criticized the conduct of police officers. The Supreme Court did not find any evidence to substantiate the charge and said the police behaved with ‘mala fide’ intent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRuby Khan, along with 13 others protesters from Nepalgunj, led a protest demanding justice and truth, after the District Police Office of Banke refused to investigate the case of the suspicious death of Nakunni Dhobi and disappearance of Nirmala Kurmi. Both cases are linked to land acquisition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn 19 October, an agreement was reached between Ruby and the government to immediately start an investigation. A six-member investigation committee led by the joint secretary of the Home Ministry was formed and submit an investigation report within a week. Following the investigation, the police arrested seven accused on the charge of abducting and killing Nirmala Kurmi, but Badshah Kurmi, a Nepali Congress leader.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn 28 November, the seven accused were released on bail. Ruby Khan was disappointed as the case was supposed to be taken to court instead the government prosecutor’s office released the culprits. Ruby Khan is apprehensive about the ongoing issue and fears justice will be denied, and claims that police did not arrest Badshah Kurmi, due to his political affiliation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal is a democratic nation founded on the basis of respect for the fundamental rights of the people. Freedom to peaceful assembly, freedom of expression and freedom to voice discontent are the fundamental rights of citizens enshrined in the Constitution and the protection of these rights is the responsibility of the state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Human Rights Commission called upon the police and security forces several times not to use force against protesters. Despite such notice, the security forces have allegedly failed to comply with the request and the state stands charged for not holding security forces accountable for the alleged abuse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we refer to the State, it includes the judiciary, legislative and the executive organs of the governments. In certain cases the state itself may violate human rights through action or omission and such acts or omission by such organs when acting in official capacity may or may not be attributed to the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Violence and Discrimination against Woman</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Political Deadlock Results in Expiry of Ordinance to Tackle Crime against Women</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When PM Sher Bahadur Deuba took office in July, the discontent and turmoil between the opposition members led to a government shutdown. The deadlock in parliament led to delay in the approval of important ordinance to tackle punishment for rape and acid attack. The political deadlock also led to the ordinance lapsing in the parliament after it failed to be ratified within 60 days of being presented to the House.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsensus between the political parties on democratic values is imperative for successful implementation of constitutional provisions. In Nepali politics, political expediency and powerplay has always superseded the rule of law exploring mockery of democracy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDecember marks the winter session in the Parliament where the ordinances will be tabled by the ministers. The Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Dilendra Badu will table the Ordinance to Amend Criminal Offences as well as Procedure Acts and the Ordinance to Amend the Sexual Violence Act. Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand will table the Acid and other Harmful Substances (Regulation) Ordinance in the House. It is in the best interest of the people of Nepal that there is no obstruction in the parliamentary proceedings again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Discriminatory Laws against Women</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Women’s rights activists and their supporters demonstrated a protest in Kathmandu calling for an end to discrimination against women and scrapping of proposal issued by the Department of Immigration (DoI) imposing restriction on travel for women. On Feb 10, the Department of Immigration (DoI) of Nepal submitted a notorious proposal to the Ministry of Home Affairs that states that a woman must obtain permit letters from their male counterpart or the head of the family as well as the ward office in order to travel abroad. The proposed rule was said to be applicable to first time woman travellers below 40 travelling to Gulf or African countries on visit visa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the immigration department, the proposed rule is an initiative to reduce the risk of human trafficking. The proposed rule is aimed at providing protection to vulnerable women susceptible to human trafficking in Gulf and African nations which happens often due to limited economic opportunities, illiteracy, or low education.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though the idea and motivation behind this policy aims to provide protection to women, one may argue that such a move contradicts the constitutional provisions that guarantee equal and fair treatment of all citizens. However, the other perspective that one may consider is, that this policy may protect illicit trafficking of under-age girls and other women to foreign countries for the purposes of sex trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Demonstration Demanding- to Scrap Tax on Sanitary Pads</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Civil Society and Woman staged a demonstration demanding the government to remove the tax levied on sanitary pads, claiming the pads are a basic need. The demonstrator used banners and placards with slogans such as: ‘don’t impose a tax on my period’, ‘think more than blood money’ and ‘period is taxing in itself’. The government stated that they did not increase tax on sanitary napkins. Nevertheless, the public outcry and protest has rekindled the public debate on the taxation of feminine hygiene products like sanitary napkins- which should be an essential product but are categorized as luxury items. Essential products including medicines, medical supplies, contraceptives, and condoms—that are exempt from VAT.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExempting the taxes on menstrual products and making it an essential item may make it accessible to millions of rural women thereby possibly addressing the problem of menstrual hygiene including the social taboo surround menstruation. Furthermore, exempting the taxes on menstrual products will bring them under the umbrella of essential commodities thereby giving it the status of the medicine which may play a role in safeguarding the rights of women to safe motherhood and reproductive health stipulated under article 38 of the Constitution of Nepal 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Bhagirathi Rape Case</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On February 3, Bhagirathi Bhatta, 17, from Baitadi was raped and murdered brutally. Her body was recovered from the Tawalek Community Forest on February 4. The alarming incident ignited a public outrage, wherein students and youths in the far western districts came out into the streets, in protest, seeking justice for Bhagirathi Bhatta. The demonstrations continued in all the nine districts of Sudurpaschim Province – including Baitadi where the crime took place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government has been accused for turning a blind eye to crimes against women in view of their responses to the previous rape case for examples; devastating incidents of Nirmala Panta’s and Samjhana BK’s rape and murder cases. There was an increasing apprehension in the public that this case too would be left unresolved. Nevertheless, it is relevant to note that the police carried out an investigation and arrested the alleged perpetrator on February 16. As per the 17-year-old perpetrator’s confession, the crime was committed as an ‘act of vengeance’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Recorded Crime against Women</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past five month, Nepal Police recorded 9,240 cases of crime against women. 7,329 cases of domestic violence. A total number of 993 women above 18 and 104 minor girls were raped. A total of 331 rape attempt complaints were filed with the police during this period. 19 cases of child marriage, 76 cases of women trafficking, 12 cases of unnatural sex and 25 cases of witchcraft violence were registered with the police. The comparative study claims that the incidents of rape have decreased by almost 10 per cent this year compared to last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Caste Based Discrimination Cases</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The two major cases in this behalf that gathered media attention were the murder of Bhim Bahadur Bishwakarma, a 58 years old Dalit man from Chitwan, wanting to enter a temple during festival season; and Rupa Sunar inability to rent a house owing to her caste.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the incident, supporters of the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) staged a demonstration at Maitighar Mandala, demanding that the government ensure social justice and take action against the murderers of Bhim Bahadur Bishwakarma which resulted in arrest being made in the case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCivil Society and human rights activists demonstrated in the streets to protest the state inaction to conduct an impartial investigation into Rupa Sunar case. When the case gained public attention a formal complaint was registered by the police and which resulted in the arrest of the accused Saraswati Pradhan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is when the former education Minister Krishna Gopal Shrestha went to the police station to receive Pradhan in his official car that this case gained political traction. What was an initial a case of caste based discrimination was escalated into a social rift issue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe trend of involvement of ministers in high-profile cast-based discrimination case and taking the side of accused has sidelined the main issue by making it an issue of ethnic colour or religious debate. Furthermore, cases of alleged abuses by police and their refusal to register the FIR is becoming rampant. Trends indicates that when the case gets public attention only is when the case is registered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNon-registration of a complaint by the police results in dereliction of the duty which may additionally result in the denial of human rights. Murder, disappearance and caste-based discrimination and untouchability is a crime committed against the state. Hence, in such cases it becomes important for the police to register the complaint and file the cases in court, investigate and defend them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs per Nepal’s legal commitment towards effective implementation of the fundamental right against untouchability and discrimination specified in Article 24 of the Constitution of Nepal; the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a direction to all district administration offices, district police offices and all police units to set up and operate Dalit-targeted help desks in all Nepal Police offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Demonstration on the Constitution Day</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitution Amendment March was organised by civil society activists calling themselves the ‘Brihat Nagarik Andolan’ (People’s Movement) on the anniversary of the Constitution, which falls on 19 September.Historically marginalized groups, including Madhesis, Janajatis, women’s activists, Dalits and religious minorities led the Amendment March. The protesters who were found burning the copies of the constitution were arrested. Indigenous people, women, Madhesi, Dalits and other marginalized communities wanted an inclusive state through its restructuring along the line of federalism on the basis of national regional autonomy. According to them, the constitution is flawed and serves the interests of the people from the dominant ruling class, which has been in power for a long time. Referred as black day; 19 September is viewed as a violation of repeated commitments to inclusive and progressive state, made during Nepal’s peace-building process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Proportional and Inclusive Representation in Politics</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the year, political parties, feminist associations and human rights activists launched a discussion and hosted several programs on various occasion advocating mandatory 33% seat for woman including proportional and inclusive principles in the central committee and office-bearers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCPN (UML): The number of women in office has increased while the presence of Dalits and Madhesis has also increased in the tenth general convention. 53 women have been elected unopposed as CPN-UML’s central members from the women’s category.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2 women, 1 Dalit and 1 Madhesi community leaders were elected as an office bearer. Ashtalakshmi Shakya, elected as the vice president and Padma Aryal as the secretary. Similarly, Chhavilal Bishwakarma of Dalit community and Raghuvir Mahaseth of Madhesi community were elected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepali Congress: The Congress has elected 13 office bearers, of which only one is woman- Mahalakshmi Upadhyaya ‘Dina’. Jeevan Pariyar was appointed as the union joint general minister. He is the only leader from Dalit community to become an official in the last 64 years. Bhishmaraj Aangdembe has been elected as the joint general minister of the Congress Adivasi Janajati. The convention failed to give a strong message of inclusion, as no Madhesi or Tharu were elected as either vice-president or general secretary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAppointment of Billionaire Binod as a central committee member of the Nepali Congress (NC) under the Madhesi cluster in the 14th General Convention of the party has raised a moral and legal question on his win.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaoist Center: 35 percent women and 20 percent youth- under the age of 40, of the total number of 299- member central committees have been made mandatory in the ongoing convention. Maoist will elect 15-member office- bearers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Challenges</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Prime Minister and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba has claimed that Nepal is the only country to ensure 33% representation of women in every body of the state. Furthermore, Nepal has represented Dalits, Janajatis and Adivasis at every level of the state and party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite mandatory 33% women’s representation and the inclusive principle; minority form only a small percentage in the top leadership roles and are purported discriminated against even at work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe presence of women does not necessarily guarantee that women’s interests are protected. Furthermore, the ‘substantive representation’ of women requires not only the presence of women representatives but requires commitment and action to uphold their position. It has been observed that, Women representatives from province and local level (Deputy Chief and Vice-Chair-person) have expressed their grievance stating that women are treated as second class citizens in the office and are not taken seriously. Throughout their term, they did receive any support or encouragement from any people’s representative and their official term came to an end without fully discharging their responsibility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, Dalit people’s representatives have complained about social discrimination at their office. People don’t accept them as leaders, they are not taken seriously and are assaulted while discharging their duty. Tara Devi Paswan, the Ward Member of Kalaiya 27, was tied to a pole and assaulted by a gang of local people who accused her helping a woman elope rather than discouraging her.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Impact of Covid-19 on Marginalised Communities</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Social commentator and Professor Sanjeev Upreti states “the crisis revealed the real status of socialism, the status of humanity and democratic practices which have been talked about for long”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAside from loss of lives, jobs, and social security, the second wave of Covid-19 turned out to be even more disastrous; impacting the hospital industry- with the shortage of oxygen, ICU beds, and ventilators. Resource scarcity and accessibility to health services deprived people their right to emergency health services from the state, guaranteed under article 35 of the Constitution of Nepal, 2015. Vulnerable populations and marginalized communities who could not afford private hospitals, were forced to return to their homes due to lack of beds and oxygen in the government hospital. The Covid-19 pandemic pushed the marginalised community even further into the vulnerability. Caste based discrimination continued even in the government quarantine, where a man in Saptari died of starvation. A man named Raju Sada died in isolation after not receiving medication for diarrhoea. Food material and medication did not reach many Dalits, even though it was distributed through ward offices.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1670841080_NP_KTM_IMG_1881-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-02-09', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 22:16:20', '2022-12-12 22:16:20');

A nation should have unanimity among political parties on foreign policy so that Nepal’s critical national interests are not jeopardized even if the government changes. However, Nepal’s foreign policy is usually driven by the interest of the political leaders to remain in power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe former Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli’s foreign policy was tough to crack. It is observed in the past that Nepal’s communist leaders resorted to anti-Indian sentiments to fortify their domestic position, as Nationalism is a popular political card in Nepal. Oli used this card from the beginning of his tenure and tilted towards northern neighbors to reduce Nepal’s reliance on India. However, during his term, Oli could not strengthen relations with China. Oli’s foreign policy oscillated from China to India. While he claimed that India was trying to oust him from power, subsequently, he met India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Samant Kumar Goel. Following Goel’s visit, Oli stated that the “misunderstanding with New Delhi has been resolved.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter months of political turmoil, the Supreme Court-appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba as the new Prime Minister. With the change in leadership, there seems to be a shift in Nepal’s geopolitical scenario. In a press conference, New Foreign Affairs stated that the country’s foreign policy is not unique to any one political party and builds national consensus amongst all the parties on issues relating to foreign relations. However, the proclivities of the new government towards India can be felt.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">A Shift in Nepal-China Relation</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s political instability has remained a source of tremendous concern for China. This is clear from Chinese envoy Hou Yanqi’s persistent efforts to reconcile two factions of the NCP and prevent the party from splitting. Chinese ambassador met President Bidhya Devi Bhandari, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and other party officials on December 20.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter repeated failed attempts of reuniting the two factions, a four-member Chinese delegation led by Guo Yenzhou, a vice-minister of the Communist Party of China’s International Department, arrived in Nepal. The delegation held meetings separately with several leaders, including KP Oli, Madhav Kumar Nepal, Puspa Kamal Dahal, Jhalanath Khanal, and Baburam Bhattarai. The team strived to conciliate the fallouts between Oli and Dahal, conveying that China wants political stability in Nepal. The Chinese endeavor in Nepal makes China no longer a non-interfering neighbor. China recently appeared as a major player in the domestic politics of Nepal. However, China was unsuccessful in keeping Nepal’s communist party intact, which was seen as a significant geopolitical loss for China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChinese concerns regarding Nepal’s domestic political regime and the ruling party’s apparent affinity towards India are amply visible. The Chinese newspaper Global Times, which follows party lines, claimed that Nepal’s new Prime Minister is ‘pro-Indian.’ Further, Chinese infrastructural projects have halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, the standard operating procedure for enforcing the Transit and Transportation Agreement with China has yet been formulated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina also formed a quad to enhance its influence in south-east Asia. Nepal is a member of the quad. China strives to improve border connections and then open trade and transit infrastructure to increase its strategic influence in Nepal. As a landlocked country with various developmental limitations, it is preferable to gain benefits and use them positively to achieve national interests. Nepal must design a comprehensive plan to reap benefits considering national interest. However, joining a development opportunity and joining a strategic alliance is not the same thing. For Nepal, patterning with strategic allies and being a part of a regional power bloc is a serious consideration, where a misjudgment could cost heavily.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, Deuba led government revived the border dispute in Humla. The government formed a team to study the Northern border. The team produced a report stating the border encroachment in Sino- Nepal Border. However, China refutes all the border dispute claims made by Nepal. Moreover, Chinese concern stems from the country’s growing propensity towards India and the continual US pressure to ratify MCC. According to the intelligence report by Nepal’s security authorities, Chinese intelligence has been actively generating anti-MCC sentiments in Nepal. According to the report, China aims to sever Nepal’s relations with other nations, particularly the United States. China’s influence may have decreased at the governmental level and diluted after the split of the Communist party. However, its influence is intact in other state machinery. Chinese envoy reached KP Oli’s residence to congratulate him on being elected as UML chairperson. Yanqi is the first foreign envoy to congratulate Oli.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Warming up Ties with India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s relationship had hit rock-bottom amid the territorial dispute when Nepal amended its constitution to incorporate the territories of Kalapani, Lipulek, and Limpiyadhura on its map and national emblem. However, both countries understand that it is essential to maintain a good relationship with their neighbors. Nepal’s former minister, Pradeep Gyawali, participated in the Sixth Meeting of the Nepal-India Joint Commission on January 15 to refurbish the loosened tied between India and Nepal. They discussed several issues such as trade, connectivity, infrastructural projects, and covid-19 vaccines. However, India was reluctant to discuss the ongoing border dispute. Further, Foreign Minister was also refused a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The relationship with India at the beginning of the year was not free-flowing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiplomatic sensitivities flared up again after a Nepali national went missing on July 30 after India’s Sashastra Seema Bal detached the improvised cable crossing. The government initially seemed reluctant to address the issue even after submitting the probe report. After many criticisms, the government finally sent a diplomatic note. However, no positive development has been seen on the issue. It is observed that India tends to undermine Nepal’s concerns and only deals with issues that furthers its interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal has been warming up its ties with India. Vijay Chauthaiwale, India’s ruling party’s (BJP) Foreign Affairs Department’s chief, visited KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba, Puspa Kamal Dahal and Mahant Thakur to strengthen connections with Nepali political parties. Further, the new Foreign Minister Narayan Khadka met his India Counterpart S. Jaishankar on UNGA sidelines in New York. Jaishankar expressed his desire to enhance his special ties with Nepal. Further, the Nepali Congress strives to build a party-to-party relationship with BJP. A three-member delegation led by Prakash Saran Mahat visited New Delhi on October 7. They met BJP’s President JP Nadda, National General Secretary Arun Singh, Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar, and Vijay Chuathaiwala. The Nepali Congress has been attempting to strengthen ties with India’s ruling party since 2014. The visit was also an attempt to bridge the gap between the Nepali Congress and BJP. The delegation also met Uttar Pradesh’s Adityanath Yogi, where he stressed the importance of Nepal conserving and preserving its culture and religion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn November 2, Deuba also met his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi. They discussed resolving all kinds of problems between the two Nations. The meeting is seen as a massive step in repairing relations with the neighbor, who has been at odds for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">MCC, a Focal Point for Nepal-US Relations</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MCC has been a pressing issue over the past four years. The controversy surrounding MCC and its politicization has obstructed its parliamentary endorsement. The political parties have a divided stance regarding it. The CPN (Maoist Center) and CPN (US) have vehemently opposed the compact’s ratification. While CPN-UML has not disclosed its new stance on MCC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe US is persistently pressuring the Deuba-led government to ratify MCC immediately. Deuba has always supported ratifying the MCC. Further, the supposed distant relation between the Nepali Congress and China created a feasible atmosphere for the US to press down on MCC ratification. This is evident by the multiple exchanges and visits from high-levels US officials. On July 27, US Secretary of State Antony J Blinken called Prime Minister Deuba to discuss MCC during his visit to Delhi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, the vice president of the Department of Compact Operations of MCC, Fatima Z. Sumar visit on September 9. The US tried clarifying all the concerns regarding MCC so that Nepal could decide and expedite the ratification process. Nevertheless, she expounded that the compact cannot be amended. Further, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu and his Deputy Assistant Secretary Kelly Keiderling Visited Kathmandu on December 17 and 18, respectively. Lu met Deuba, KP Sharma Oli, and Pushpa Kamal Dahal separately to deliberate upon MCC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a strong push from the US and continuous follow-ups, Prime Minister Deuba is trying to forge consensus among his coalition partners. The ruling coalition has formed a three-member committee chaired by Jhalanath Khanal to develop a report on MCC. The alliance will move forward with endorsement based on the committee’s report. The delay in endorsing MCC and lackadaisical approach towards MCC has enfeebled Nepal’s international development credibility. Nonetheless, endorsing MCC would perhaps rile China up, which is doing everything it can to impede parliament ratification of MCC. The government should tread prudently in evaluating the compact, placing Nepal’s national interest at the forefront. Endorsing MCC will help Nepal in Nepal’s economic objectives and strengthen ties with the US. Nevertheless, failing to ratify the compact will impact the relationship with one of its most significant development partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Vaccine Diplomacy</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal faced a grave vaccine crisis in the initial few months of the year. The Covax initiative, which was meant to assist these countries in gaining equal access to vaccines, has failed to meet its commitment. The President has written to the leader of numerous countries, including India, China, the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States, requesting vaccine assistance. Nonetheless, Nepal received no response. The lack of response from these states indicates a diplomatic failure and a loss of Nepal’s credibility, which is a critical element of diplomacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn June, the US provided 1.5 doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines to Nepal through the COVAX facility. According to US Ambassador to Nepal, the US Ambassador to Nepal, the US would not indulge in vaccine trade political purposes. The vaccines offered are a gift from the United States, he stated. The deed, while noble, is indicative of an underlying intent, as ‘gifts’ are often questioned in international affairs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia initially tried accelerating its neighborhood first policy regarding the vaccine. However, it failed to take off as anticipated. Therefore, leveraging on India’s failure, china has been generously supplying Nepal with vaccines, attempting to retighten its loosened hold on Nepal. China has implemented a policy of granting visas exclusively to people who have received a Chinese vaccine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Development Cooperation Trend</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chinese foreign aid to Nepal significantly decreased from $150 million in 18/19 to $100 million and remained constant in FY 20/21. The foreign aid trend from India saw a significant increase in FY 19/20. However, FY 20/21 saw a downward trend. Similarly, the foreign aid contribution from the US increased in FY 19/20 but decreased in FY 20/21. Development partners ‘ disbursements have dropped because the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the global economy into a recession. Concerning BRI, China’s economy saw a decline due to the pandemic. Nepal may be unable to obtain loans from China to fund BRI projects, and China may also be unable to provide grants to BRI projects in Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal receives bilateral assistance primarily for infrastructure development and capacity building; if infrastructure aid is reduced, development initiatives will suffer significantly. Reduced capacity-building support will have a massive effect on Nepal’s governance and accountability.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1670842567_Ros-Ktm-2-2048x1830.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-02-09', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 22:41:07', '2022-12-12 22:57:32'),

Although, all the seven provinces have instituted important laws (like the Provincial Police Act, Provincial Public Service Commission, Provincial Civil Service, and Employees Adjustment Act), the centralized mindset and lack of accountability in the leaders and federal bureaucrats, pose a challenge. For example, Province 2 filed five writ petitions against the federal government accusing it of encroaching on the provincial government’s jurisdiction. Considerable evidence exists of the central government trying to interfere with the Sagarnath Forest Development Project, Forest Act, Employees Adjustment Act, and Provincial Police Act, even if, schedule 6 in the constitution affirms that the provincial government’s right to these areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe federal government also failed to endorse e provincial laws. Province 2 endorsed Provincial Police Act without waiting for the Federal Police Act, but the provincial government did not enact the existing laws, due to lack of consensus in the political parties. The federal raised difficulty in formulating the provincial bills, Provincial Police Act and Provincial Public Service Commission, and had to support the provincial government in forming the laws. As a consequence, the government has failed to implement their rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe meetings of the Inter-State Council were also held only twice, in December 2018 and April 2019 in the five-year tenure of the election. The government had to work as a bridge between the federal and provincial governments’ functions through the Council. But former PM Oli and PM Deuba did not create positive vibes through the Council meetings in 2021. The Council meeting has thus been affected due to lack of political consensus and the major political parties preoccupied with their general conventions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo of the seven provinces still don’t have their names and permanent capitals, although only six months remain of the electoral firm. Consensus among the political parties is yet to be reached in Provinces 1 and 2.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the Provincial Governments have somehow succeeded to form a member of laws in 2021. Province 2 set up an Investigation Bureau for investigation of criminal incidents. Province 2 inaugurated and Agriculture University focused on the induction of the Technical University. Local Governments started an online payment system. Bagmati Province also announced a Common Minimum Program targeting COVID-19 control. But weak coordination of the bodies concerned hampers implementation of policies and laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Frequent Changes of CMs and Governor</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, the implementation of federalism got delayed after Oli’s move to dissolve the parliament. Nepali Congress and other four parties, which form the main coalition party, were mainly responsible for filing a vote of no-confidence motion nine times against KP Oli’s government in Province 1 by Chief Ministers Sher Dhan Rai and Bhim Acharya; in Bagmati by Chief Minister Dormani Paudel and Asta Laxmi Shakya; in Gandaki by Chief Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung; and in Lumbini Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel between January 2 and September 26 and Oli lost his government one by one in the six provinces including at the federal level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll provinces then also went through a vote of confidence motion after the party-split in 2021. The frequent changes of the chief ministers and votes of confidence affected the administration in the provinces. From June to November, the political parties were found playing a game for the distribution of power-sharing. This year, more than two chief ministers were appointed in Provinces 1 and Bagmati and the CM in Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali were changed twice. Such practices contribute to unstable governments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrequent changes in the role of provincial governors also impacted the provincial assemblies’ function. From February 19 to November 8, President Bhandari, on the recommendation of the government replaced new governors in all the seven provinces. The central government has been using the governors as a political weapon and some of them were changed more than twice abruptly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlmost all the provinces took a long time in cabinet expansion after the government change. The coalition government led by PM Deuba could expand his cabinet after 87, days on October 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Split Provincial Ministries</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Except for Province 1 and Sudhurpaschim, all provincial governments have split ministries for the distribution of power-sharing. However, the provincial governments are facing a lack of employees before increasing ministries, and now more difficult is its function after the increase. At present, there stands 69 provincial ministries across the country. According to the Ministry of Federal Affairs, the provincial governments have split the ministries without conducting an organization and management due to which they are not able to send the required number of employees. Such a split in the provincial ministries has continued to hamper the smooth functioning of provincial and local government, whilst also increasing the financial expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Poor Capital Budget Expenditure</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not new that the government has yet again failed to expend a proper share of the capital budget, most of which will get spent at the end of the fiscal year. In the fiscal year 2020-21, the government’s capital expenditure stood at just 65 percent, including a large capital budget was spent in a week. Like every year, this year too, the government emphasized more upon the Asadhe Bikash (capital expenditure at the end of the fiscal year).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, in this current fiscal year 2021-22, the government spent just 6.46 capital budget in five months. This is the lowest capital expenditure compared to the last three fiscal years in the same time duration. While the government had announced to implement at least 10% by the first three months, and 10% each month following the capital budget at any cost. According to the government’s announcement, it should have been able to spend at least 40 percent of the capital budget. But due to the political and law barrier, the government has spent poor capital budget expenditure said the Finance Minister Janardhan Sharma, vice-chair of National Planning Commission Biswanath Paudel, and Finance Secretary Madhu Kumar Marasini. This is also a signal that the ruling alliance government tend to repeat the Asadhe Bikash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, according to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration (MOFAGA), eight local governments (5 municipalities and 3 rural municipalities) in Province 2 have not brought the budget so far of the current fiscal year 2020/21. Only two months have left for the fiscal year to end. However, compared to the previous years, the number of local bodies submitting and passing the budget on the time has been gradually increasing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlmost all provinces including the federal government led by Oli brought the budget through an ordinance in the fiscal year 2021-22. Due to the political disagreement, the ruling government was obliged to unveil the budget through the ordinance. But the same thing happened when the coalition party’s administration in four provinces (Province 1, Bagmati, Lumbini, and Gandaki) including the federal government revised the budget through the Replacement bill in all seven provinces including federal. That means both governments – Oli and Deuba tried to manipulate the budget. This is the last tenure before the election, the Deuba government like Oli government seems to have unveiled the budget as with an election-orientation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe constitution of Nepal has made several provisions for equitable distribution of resources among governments entities considering inter-governmental fiscal transfer as one of the significant components of fiscal federalism. For the same, The National Natural Resource and Fiscal Commission (NNRFC) was established. However, Dr. Rudra Sharma, an expert on fiscal federalism stated that the central government is intrinsically hegemonies over the province and local government, consequently, affecting the implementation of Fiscal Federalism. The Ministry of Finance has limited rights to the NNRFC. For effective implementation of the budget, the government has to revise the procurement laws, policies and budget expenditure system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn September 29, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has raided the office of the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers in Province 2. A team of CIAA has alleged that Province 2 has been involved in irregularities in bicycles purchases under the campaign ‘Beti Bachau-Beti Padhau’ (Educate Daughter, Save Daughter). Meanwhile, CM Raut has stated that the raiding of CIAA in the chief minister’s office discredits federalism and the provincial government. CM also said there are no irregularities and arrears-related activities from the office.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, the effective implementation of federalism is a critical lack of coordination among the governments. At present, several challenges appear such as coordination, law formation, and implementation, COVID-19 control, functioning of bodies. The people have hoped from the upcoming election for new candidates and effective functioning of the government bodies. Federalism is still unsettled in the country; still, three tiers of government are struggling with the implementation of federalism for the formation of law and its practice. In the last year, the political parties were highly engaged in the power control, which affects the locals as well. Previously, CPN-UML had secured a comfortable majority in six of the seven provinces. At present, Nepali Congress, Maoist Center, and CPN-US had led in six provinces, with each party having two provinces, and Janata Samajbati Party ruling in the remaining Province 2. Now leaders are busy with the election-based work but lack the consensus between the Election Commission and the political parties, which is likely to affect the upcoming election.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1670843519_HB_Gandaki_8368-1987x2048.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-02-09', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-12 22:56:59', '2022-12-16 19:13:29'),

The 2017 elections installed three tiers of government—federal, provincial, and local and its practice. The year 2021 saw a strong influence of the center politics that affected implementation of functioning in provinces as well as local government.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">General Convention of Political Parties Reelects Old Party Chairs</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The general conventions of CPN-UML and Nepali Congress reelected former party chairs for the next tenure while The Maoist Center concluded its convention with the Central Committee members handpicked by Prachanda and who was appointed the chairman by the newly appointed Central Committee. The lack of debates on ideological orientation of the party and rigorous discussion on party’s further political pathway within CPN-UML and Nepal Congress’ conventions signals the pertinent ideological crisis within the parties. While the Prachanda brought into discussion the Party’s further strategy, it was criticized by the convention representatives claiming it to be incomplete and failing to analyze the current political concerns. Prachanda remained silent on the counter-proposal tabled by Dev Gurung and dissenting views forwarded by other leaders. The failure of Prachanda to answer the issues upon his ideological and political report indicates the growing dissatisfaction of party cadres with their leadership, including the issues of lavish lifestyles of Maoist leaders and their (il)licit relationship with big contractors and businessmen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe common pattern among the three major parties is the consolidation of the ruling elites in the leadership, sidelining the principles of inclusion in the selection of office holders. This is visible among the personalities appointed for UML’s top party positions and candidates elected for Nepali Congress leadership. Although Nepali Congress tried to make its structure inclusive through reservation system for various identity clusters in the positions of deputy general secretary, the candidates from minorities, female and other unrepresented groups got largely defeated in direct elections for various party posts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExcept Nepali Congress, the lack of democratic norms within intra-party politics was vividly surfaced during the convention of the major three political parties. UML chairman Oli’s motive was to appoint all leadership positions and central committee members through consensus, restricting dissent and competition. Although he was challenged by Bhim Rawal for the post of the party chair, Oli handpicked most of the central committee members and office bearers. Oli’s strong disregard of democratic practice, ideological discussions or political programs in the disguise of consensus politics and his desire to be appointed as the unchallenged party president reflects his authoritarian dynamics and institutionalization of his cult personality within the party. Furthermore, even during the Maoist’s convention, democratic elections for party positions were sidelined in the name of appointing the office bearers and central committee members through consensus. In this regard, Nepali Congress took a different approach selecting its party officials and central committee members more democratically.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe selection of youths in the top party positions within the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress has been seen as a positive move. The appointment of new generation politicians Gagan Thapa and Bishwo Prakash Sharma as the General Secretaries of Nepali Congress, and of Gokarnaraj Bista and Yogesh Bhattarai as Secretaries of CPN-UML among many other youths in various central positions more positive steps to shift the party leadership to the younger generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">House dissolution, Government Changes, Parliament Obstruction and Implications</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After the factions in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) when Prachanda and Madhav Kumar Nepal proposed a motion of no confidence amid Oli’s increasing autocratic behavior within the party and government, Oli decided to dissolve the House in December 2020 and called for fresh elections. However, Oli’s move was overturned by the supreme court. Further in March 2021, the supreme court invalidated the NCP and revived CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Center which subsequently led to the withdrawal of CPN-Maoist Center’s support to the government, compelling Oli to seek a vote of confidence as per the constitutional provision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOli failed to obtain the required confidence vote, rendering Oli’s cabinet into a caretaker. However, he was again appointed prime Minister in May as opposition failed to lay their claim for the post. Aware that he could not get the required vote of a confidence, Oli dissolved The House again second time and declared a fresh election for November which was blindly approved by the President. This unconstitutional move again pushed the country towards instability and political turmoil. However, in July the Supreme Court dismissed the Oli’s recommendation and President’s approval to dissolve the House and appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime minister as demanded by the opposition alliance (Nepali Congress, CPN-Maoist Center, CPN (US), Janata Samajwadi Party and Rastriya Janamorchha). Further, the Madhav Nepal faction formed a new party CPN (US) away from Oli-led required charging if as autocratic and undemocratic nature.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Nepal had finally attained a stable government with a two-third majority, Oli’s arrogance eventually led to its dissolution twice. Together with the support of President Bidya Devi Bhandari, PM Oli politicized both the presidential and parliamentarian institutions for his personal interest. A whole show of questions has been thrown at the president’s approval of Oli’s moves which has diluted the dignity of the president’s institution. UML was seen obstructing the House proceedings after the Speaker denied to strip the 14 lawmakers who formed the CPN (US) including Madhav Kumar Nepal. This irresponsible act of the main opposition, (CPN-UML) hindered the House passage of a number of bills including crucial bills related to the federal civil servants and Provincial Police Ordinance, 2078.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe dynamics of central politics and coalition of five parties ultimately brought change in the provincial governments, isolating CPN-UML and overthrowing the chief ministers representing CPN-UML. Previously, the CPN-UML-led governments ruled in six provinces except in Province 2. But Oli now lost the federal government as also the six provincial governments. The current political dynamics signal continuation of five party alliance in the upcoming general election at least on an ad-hoc basis to challenge the CPN-UML which had established itself as the largest party in the last general election.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Split in the Nepal Communist Party and Its Consequences</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal Communist Party (NCP) which found itself divided into three parties, squandered a historic opportunity to lead the country toward political stability and usher economic prosperity. One key reason behind all this was the complete dominance that KP Sharma Oli sought over the party, and various levels of government. After Oli assumed the position of the Prime Minister, he consolidated his power under him by putting several constitutional entities under his authority. Despite an agreement between Oli and NCP co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal to lead the government for two and a half years each, Oli failed to fulfill his side of the bargain, enraging Prachanda.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result, in the battle for the NCP’s leadership, Dahal established an unofficial alliance with Madhav Kumar Nepal, to unseat Oli. The NCP drifted apart amid this scenario. The Supreme Court decided that the consolidation of May 2018 between CPN-UML and CPN- MC was unlawful. After the Court’s ruling, the party’s two factions, the CPN UML led by Oli and the CPN-MC led by Dahal restored their original status as independent political parties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to ideological in coherence, mismanaged leadership and Oli’s ego, the unity among the largest communist parties could not sustain. It is apparent that while Communist parties in Nepal may unite and win elections, but sustaining their unity and electoral victory are different matters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the factionalism within CPL UML continued, Madhav Kumar Nepal felt sidelined within the party since his supporters were overlooked in the party’s rank. Prime Minister Deuba tried to make the most of the circumstances by destabilizing CPN-UML, and introduced an ordinance allowing any group of a political party to split the party with an approval of at least 20 percent of the parliamentary party’s or Central Committee’s members which, ultimately led to Madhav Kumar Nepal’s faction to part its way to set up a new party – CPN (Unified Socialist).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Allegation against the Chief Justice and Protest Impacts the Supreme Court’s Hearings</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana was embroiled in a heated controversy after he allegedly demanded a share in Prime Minister Deuba’s Cabinet, changed with seeking a ministerial berth for his brother-in-law, who got appointed as a minister on October 8. Since Hamal was not a member of the parliament, it was assumed that his entrance was a part of a deal between PM Deuba and Chief Justice Rana to overturn Oli’s attempt at House dissolution. When questions were raised over his appointment, PM Deuba requested Hamal to resign the position. Hamal’s appointment and resignation have put Chief Justice Rana and PM Deuba into the spotlight for disturbing the separation of power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the incident, Nepal Bar Association (NBA), Supreme Court justices, and lawyers demanded resignation of Chief Justice Rana. Rana rejected the allegation and refused to resign but was seen prepared to take “impeachment motion” in the parliament. Following the statement, a protest was launched on 25 October against Rana, demanding his resignation. The lawyers stopped chief justice from entering the Supreme Court and the protests escalated into a scuffle between lawyers and the police when many sustained injuries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the gravity of the situation, political parties on both the ruling and opposition sides have so far been silent on the issue. The on-going controversy in the judiciary is an outcome of political meddling and flawed appointment processes. Political analysts and experts are of the opinion that political parties appoint their party workers, arbitrarily in the constitutional posts and to protect their party workers and avoid controversy, hold them silence on the issue. Such unethical practice prevails from Panchayat days and the practice of ‘bench buying’ in the Supreme Court services. The protests effected the court hearings, as also people’s right to justice. Concerned with the judicial deadlock, the International Human Rights Organizations and the Chief of eight constitutional commissions body appealed to the parties in the dispute to find a solution to the deadlock through mutual dialogue. The supreme court justices have decided to implement a lottery system effective from December 1. This effort is an initiation to an end to the long-standing tradition of the head of the judiciary assigning the cases. Nonetheless, the crisis lingers.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670926340_20210912133100__D3A6793-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-02', '2022-02-09', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-13 21:57:20', '2022-12-13 21:57:20');

First census after the country transitioned to a federal republic. Thus, census is based on the principle of inclusion as enshrined in the preamble of the Constitution of Nepal 2015. People headcount were done on the basis of the ethnicity, language, religion, sex, social class, geology, disability, age, income and gender or gender minorities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo additional ethnic group – Rana Tharu and Bahumihar has been included to the census this time, increasing the total number of ethnic groups to 127. For the first time in the census, people of gender minorities are counted as ‘third gender.’ The government has added new categories in the census of people of disability which includes haemophilia, autism, complete blindness, and deafness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nControversial remarks regarding the methodology of census and the negligence committed by the enumerators was widespread. The enumerators of the census have been alleged to use pencil while filling out the forms, instead of ink pen. This raises a question on the credibility of the census. Use of pencil is considered dubious by the citizens as they fear their answers may be altered later for political benefit. The Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities issued a statement alleging the census enumerators did not ask the questions on language and religion and themselves filled in the answers to the questions. An incident took place in Lamjung, where an enumerator was apprehended because he/she listed their religion as Hindu despite being told that they are Buddhists. Citizens also showed discontentment towards the set of questionnaires. LGBT community raised their grievance regarding the questionnaire as the questionnaire did not recognize queer people and categorized the head of the household only as man or woman, not listing themselves based on their gender identity. Questions were raised on the method of counting caste-ethnicity (jaat-jaati) by the enumerators, where they allegedly presumed the caste and ethnicity of their respondents. According to the enumerator’s handbook, jaat relates to a Hindu caste surname, whereas jaati refers to indigenous ethnicity. However, because the same question seeks to address both jaat and jaati, responding to it can be highly perplexing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCensus have significant implications in Nepali politics mainly because it will determine political and bureaucratic representation of women, Madeshis, Dalits, Indigenous and marginalised community. Census is also an innovative means for developing and executing social innovations aimed at addressing social, geographical and economic issues that affect society. However, citizens have raised their doubts over the census data for under representing people from different categories like religious minorities, language, caste and ethnicity. Thus, census should be free from controversy and doubts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">15th Anniversary of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA): Justice Due or Forgotten?</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>21 November 2021, marked the 15th anniversary of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), signed between the rebel Maoist and then Seven Party Alliance (SPA). The peace agreement signed on 21 November 2006 promised to provide justice for the thousands of victims of the decade-long insurgency. 15 years after the agreement, the victims and their families are still awaiting justice. The International Human Rights Organisations and the National Human Rights Commission have called on the Nepal government to prioritize the interests of victims and provide a credible transitional justice process, adhering to Nepal’s international obligations towards human rights. The stakeholders have urged the government to revise the Enforced Disappeared Persons and Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act in line with the international human rights principle and the verdict of the Supreme Court of Nepal at the earliest. Further, Human rights associations and the organisations of the victims have requested the government to make a public time-line with a clear action plan to conclude the existing process in consultations with the victims.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2015, the Supreme Court of Nepal ordered the government to amend Enforced Disappeared Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act in line with the international human rights principle with immediate effect. The Act provided discretionary power to recommend amnesties for those responsible for grave violations or abuses ofhuman rights. Despite the order from the Supreme Court, the Act has not been amended. However, Sher Bahadur Deuba government has pledged to implement the CPA and to amend the Enforced Disappeared Enquiry and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. But there has not been any progress.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGroup of human rights organizations and victims’ associations of Nepal have vehemently condemned Agni Sapkota’s participation in the assembly of the International Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Spain.

The government formed two transitional justice commissions six years ago. Both the commission started accepting the complaints from April 2016. However, there appears to be misunderstanding and conflict regarding the jurisdiction amongst the commissions which has delayed the investigation. Cases have been forwarded back and forth between the commissions as they are reluctant to accept such cases arguing that it is not in the commission’s mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">16 Day Campaign Against Gender-based Violence</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>November 25, marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. This day also marks the beginning of the 16 days of Activism against Gender-based Violence that lasts till December 10- the International Human Rights Day. The national slogan of this year’s 16-day campaign against gender-based violence is “Orange the World: End Violence Against Women.” President Bidya Bhandari stated that activism is important for public awareness against, evil of Chhaupadi, allegation of witchcraft, discrimination against women, and superstitions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWoman affiliated with a non-governmental organizations initiated activism at Maiti Ghar chanting “Let’s end violence against women”. One the other side of the road, women from Nepalgunj were appealing for justice for Nakunni Dhobi and Nirmala Kurmi, again. Last month, a group of 14 people led by Rubi Khan, a rights activist, from Banke, walked all the way to Kathmandu demanding justice and truth, after the District Police Office of Banke refused to investigate the case of the Nakunni Dhobi and Nirmala Kurmi. Following the protest, the government had agreed to form a six- member investigation committee lead by the joint secretary of the Home Ministry to investigate the death of Nakunni Dhobi and Nirmala Kurmi within a week. Following the investigation, the police arrested seven accused on the charge of abducting and killing Nirmala Kurmi. However, on 28 November, the seven accused were released on bail. According to Ruby Khan, the case was supposed to be taken to court but the government prosecutor’s office have released the culprit. Ruby Khan feels apprehensive about the one going issue and fears that justice will be denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Supreme Court Integrity in Jeopardy</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A protest was launched on 25 October against Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana, demanding his resignation.

Concerned with the ongoing protest against the Chief Justice, the International Human Rights Organisations have called for an end to the crisis in Nepal’s Supreme Court, by demanding a fair investigation into the allegations against Rana.

The call came amidst escalating U.S.-China tensions which analysts have also referred to as the lowest points in the relationship between the countries in decades. Since the meeting was also the first time the two leaders engaged after Biden took office, the lack of communication also became a measure of the rising tensions between China and The United States. The White House statement released after the meeting stated that “the leaders discussed areas where our interests converge and where our interests, values, and perspectives diverge”. Although the meeting did not yield a significant turn in relations between the two countries, some analysts have said that the meeting was an optimistic development positive step towards a more positive economic and political cooperation. Whereas certain analysts have argued such talks are unlikely to improve ties in the long run. The status of the island of Taiwan has become a major point of tension amidst deteriorating U.S.-China relations. In recent months, the Chinese government has escalated military and political pressure in its claims over the island while American support for Taiwan’s military has steadily escalated. The arrival of five bipartisan United States lawmakers, only days after the Xi-Biden virtual meeting has defied and riled only China. The news came a day after the Biden administration invited Taiwan to be one of the 110 delegations to a meeting of democracies to be held on December 9 and 10 wherein countries such as Russia and China have been excluded, further diplomatically bucking Beijing. The United States has thus defied China policy and does not officially recognize Taiwan. Xi Jingping has bolstered his legacy in political history in what various reports have called a “historical resolution” that documents the Chinese Communist Party’s 100-year old history and lists its key achievements. Whereas, Joe Biden has found himself under domestic pressure to take a tough position with China on economic, technological, human rights, and geopolitical fronts. While both leaders have adopted strong positions on key issues, they have acknowledged that their difference must not lead to any serious confrontations. Thus, while we can observe a classic case of posturing during great power rivalry, there also appears to be a realization that interdependence between the two countries is much too deep and the risks in terms of decoupling are not worth taking. However, the American hard line towards China on matters such as the status of Taiwan and the South China Sea also appears to undermine the sincerity of its cooperation efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Debt Trap Scare in Uganda</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The failure to amend a loan arrangement with China’s Export-Import bank has put Uganda’s only international airport, Entebbe International Airport, under the risk of being “taken over”. According to reports, Chinese rejection to renegotiate certain clauses in the 2015 deal may subject the Entebbe International Airport to be controlled by Chinese lenders. This has fanned flames to debt trap concerns in terms of projects carried out between China and many developing countries, especially in Africa. The situation with Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport regarding debt trap appears all the more dubious given the situation with after Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port became controversial after a Chinese firm got a contract The spokesperson for the Ugandan Civil Aviation Authority has refuted the claims and said that Uganda is still operating within the grace period of 7 years to repay the loan and that it wasn’t the first time such allegations had come up. Economic analysts have also suggested that it is time for the government to re-examine how it handles its agreements with donors as technically, any loan received from the Export-Import Bank is not treated as a loan but as an export, thus making it difficult to negotiate. Some analysts maintain that loan deal could become a problem if Uganda ever has trouble paying back the loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">India supports 2022 Winter Olympics to be hosted in Beijing</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian support for China to host the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games expressed in a joint communique during the 18th Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of China, Russia, and India has courted attention. The statement comes after American President Joe Biden said that the United States was considering a “diplomatic boycott” of the Beijing Winter Olympics Games citing China’s human rights abuses as a reason. The comment from the American President comes just days after his virtual meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Certain analysts have alleged that India’s position on the Beijing Winter Olympics demonstrates that “despite close ties with the United States, India maintains a strong diplomatic and strategic autonomy wherein it does not incline to the US over all regional and international affairs”. Albeit symbolic, India’s position on the matter is a positive development in Sino-Indian relationship.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1670928005_99ac64dc683a4177bc4f824f50df063e-99ac64dc683a4177bc4f824f50df063e-ffe513655ece4f988f96c97a15531237-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-12-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-13 22:25:05', '2022-12-13 22:48:06'),

At the COP26, PM Deuba has urged the world leaders to recognize the climate vulnerability in the Himalayas and to put the mountain agenda at high priority in all climate negotiations. Furthermore, PM has also highlighted the need to ensure proper support for the most vulnerable countries by scaling up financial, technological, and capacity-building resources. Similarly, 12 donor countries have pledged $413 million for the Least Developed Countries (LDC) fund which includes Nepal, to help the communities be resilient towards the impact of climate change. Although it was pledged to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to the developing countries, it hasn’t been met. Furthermore, around three quarters of the money by 2018 was in the form of loans rather than in grants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo achieve the Paris Agreement goals, each country was tasked with drafting their own pledges depending on their unique circumstances and abilities which was termed as Nationally Derived Contributions (NDC). Nepal also submitted an ambitious NDC as a part of the Paris Agreement. The document specifies that Nepal aims to reach a net zero emission by 2045. To reach the goal, Nepal aims to meet 15% of the country’s energy demand through clean energy sources and maintain 45% of the total area under forest cover by 2030. Furthermore, another major agenda is to ensure the protection of all vulnerable people from climate change by 2030. However, these pledges are conditional upon financial support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe NDCs submitted by Nepal has come under huge scrutiny for being too ambitious. The agenda for ensuring the protection of all vulnerable people from climate change is too vague as it doesn’t specify who the vulnerable population is and how their protection will be ensured. Similarly, NDC also fails to provide a proper roadmap to achieve these targets. Experts have argued that the agenda to maintain 45% of the total area under forest cover by 2030 is the only realistic agenda, as the current forest cover stands at around 40%. Although different developmental projects such as Nijgadh airport which entails cutting down of forests would severely hinder the prospect of achieving the target. Moving forward, the government should clearly identify short-term and long-term strategies, and come up with a proper framework to achieve the goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Foreign Investments in Mass Communication Media</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision of PM Deuba and Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal to jointly launch two TV channels in accordance with Ramdev has come under huge scrutiny. The two TV channels- Aastha Nepal and Patanjali Nepal will be used for broadcasting religious and yoga-related programs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a statement issued by Patanjali, the company said that the plans for the TV channels had gone through a verification process and after getting permission from the concerning bodies, the process to initiate the operations was started. However, according to the director general of Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting, Gogan Bahadur Hamal these two channels are yet to apply for the registration. An investigation committee has been formed to further investigate the details regarding this. The news saw a further backlash because the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act of 2019 restricts foreign investments on mass communication media which includes television.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a huge debate regarding foreign investments in media sector. One group argues that allowing FDI in the media sector might have serious national security implications, whereas another group argues that Nepali media organizations should open up for foreign investments which would allow for a healthy competition within these media groups. The government should recognize that a complete restriction of FDI in mass communication media, in this globalized world is difficult. Thus, FDI should be acceptable in the sector, with fair rules and regulations. Furthermore, proper mechanisms should be developed to ensure national interest, diversity of opinion, and freedom of expression and sovereignty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">New Covid-19 Variant: Omicron</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepali officials have alerted all the concerning bodies regarding the possible threats and associated risks of the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron. The concerns over the new variant surfaced after WHO classed it as a ‘variant of concern’. The variant was first detected in South Africa. After the discovery, many countries around the world have imposed travel ban on southern African countries. Following the news, Nepal has also decided to place a travel ban African nations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWHO has stressed countries to accelerate the vaccination drive after the early evidence suggested that the variant had high risk of transmission. Amidst the growing concerns over the variant, Kathmandu city has stopped vaccination campaigns after reaching a ‘demand saturation’.

On the sideline, PM Deuba also met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at a breakfast meeting. They discussed on increasing forest area in Nepal by 45%. Similarly, the meeting was held with Sri Lankan President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as well on November 2. The two leaders talked about ways to strengthen the two countries’ ties. They also highlighted the exchange of cooperation in the educational sector and the enhancement of bilateral culture. Sri Lankan President shared his desire to establish a 30-bed hospital in Lumbini. They, too, deliberated upon the promotion of tourism in both countries. PM Deuba also met Mongolian President Uknna Khurelsukh on the sidelines of COP 26. PM Deuba’s visit to the COP26 built momentum in Nepal’s diplomacy with several countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn November 2, Deuba also met his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi. They discussed upon resolving problems between Nepal and India. They further delved into Nepal’s political situation, bilateral cooperation, and SAARC Summit. PM Modi’s visit to Nepal was also part of the discussion, after which Deuba shall visit New Delhi. Further, Nepal urged India to formally establish new air routes over India from Bhairawa, Nepalgunj, and Mahendranagar. Deuba also urged India’s support in resuming chemical fertilizers exports to Nepal. However, a formal agreement awaits. The meeting is viewed as a significant boost to India’s Neighborhood First policy and mending of relations between the neighbors who had been bickering earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal-India Ties</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>PM Deuba is striving to smoothen ties with India and undo the former government’s ultra-nationalist approach. The endeavors of Nepal to repair the relationship are evident from the relationship it is trying to build on a party-to-party level and government-to-government level. PM Deuba has resumed bilateral dialogues regarding several issues including, railway, hydropower, culture, and battling the COVID-19 pandemic. India has also welcomed Nepal’s steps to refurbish the strained ties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn general, the Indo-Nepal bilateral relation is progressing somewhat on all fronts. The defense diplomacy between the two countries is being taken forward simultaneously. Army Chief Prabhuram Sharma reached New Delhi for a four-day visit on November 9 to receive the honorary rank of Maharathi of Indian Army. He also met the Indian President, Ram Nath Kovind; Defense Minister, Rajnath Singh; Chief of Staff, General Raut and Minister of external affairs, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. The spokesperson of the Nepal Army said that the Chief’s visit should not be considered a mere progression of a ceremonial tradition of the two countries but as an opportunity to create an enabling environment for addressing bilateral issues. The spokesperson has termed the engagement as military diplomacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and India have gone a step further in the energy sector as well. Previously, only exchange of surplus energy used to happen between two countries. However, as per the Nepal Electricity Authority, India granted permission to Nepal to sell 39 MW generated by the Trishuli and Devighat powerhouses in the initial phase at the Indian Energy Exchange. However, India views energy as a “strategic commodity.” India attempts to restrict the rising use of Chinese contracts, workers, and technology in Nepal’s hydropower project. As per the NEA’s proposal, electricity from 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi, 69 MW Lower Marshyangdi and 45 MW Bhotekoshi hydropower projects has not been sold in a competitive market yet. The competition between China and India is amply visible in Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, India is finally providing Nrs. One hundred crores to develop Janakpur Dham during his visit in Janakpur, which PM Modi had announced in 2018. India is trying to enhance cultural and religious links with Nepal. In doing so, it is strengthening the people-to-people connection in Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia and Nepal have also agreed to recognize the COVID-19 vaccine certificates of both countries. On November 23, the Indian Ambassador and Secretary of the Ministry of Health and Population signed a Memorandum of Understanding to accept Covid-19 certificates between the two nations. This step will ease the travel between the two countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though both the countries are putting efforts to mend the relationship, there still are areas that leave room for contention. According to the Department of Railways, Nepal has restricted foreign nationals from third countries to travel to India through the Kurtha-Jaynagar railway line after Indian Officials voiced security concerns. This was decided while completing the Standard Operating Procedure (SPA) for cross-border railway operation. Later, both the countries agreed that third-country nationals could travel on the railway within Nepal but would not be permitted to travel to India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, India delayed providing permits to the enumerators to gather information for the census in two villages bordering India in Darchula. Since there are no roads to reach there from within Nepal, people must use the road via India. However, Nepali officials are assured that India would provide permits as it would reflect poorly on India.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Sino-Nepal relations</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>China was comfortable in working with then CPN (Maoist). During the CPN (Maoist) government, there was continuous cooperation between the governments and the two countries’ parties. China’s dissatisfaction with the change in government is palpable. Moreover, the border dispute broached by the congress-led government has also shaken China. Nevertheless, China is striving towards building a people-to-people relationship with Nepal. Chinese Embassy has signed an MOU to provide an internet facility in four community schools in Pokhara. During the virtual meeting, Gandaki Province’s Minister of Education, urged the Chinese Ambassador to take the initiative to open the Korla border crossing with China as it would help in rapid development if it were operated smoothly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina has further provided 1.6 million doses of Vero cell vaccines to Nepal on November 3. It has been consistently cooperating with Nepal in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, growing inclination towards India and constant pressure from the US to endorse MCC has been the reason for Chinese anxiety. Chinese intelligence officer has been actively crafting anti-MCC rhetoric in Nepal as per the intelligence report prepared by Nepal’s security authorities. The report suggests that China is attempting to deteriorate Nepal’s ties with third countries, specifically the US. It appears that China wants sole influence in Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal-US Relations</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The US has constantly been pushing for prompt parliamentary endorsement of MCC. However, its attempts have been unsuccessful so far. Many US officials have visited Nepal multiple times. The United States Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Donald Lu, came to Kathmandu for a two-day visit. He met Prime Minister Deuba, Foreign Minister Khadka, and other political leaders. They discussed various bilateral issues and COVID 19 support. Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Kelly Keiderling also visited Kathmandu on November 18.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe US Assistant State Secretary Donald Lu met KP Sharma Oli on November 19. They deliberated upon MCC. Oli stated that he would reveal his position regarding MCC after the ruling parties decide regarding this. Minister Lu also met CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal. He said, ‘The MCC got complicated in the parliament due to its ratification clause.’ However, he also maintained that he has discussed with the Prime Minister regarding it and is planning to further discuss in all-party meeting.The US- Nepal bilateral relations are somewhat progressing while MCC remains in limbo.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1670930109_NP_KTM_20211119_IMG_1665-2048x1365.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-12-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-13 23:00:09', '2022-12-13 23:00:09');

Although chairperson Oli’s motive was to appoint all leadership positions and central committee members through consensus, restricting dissent and competition, he was challenged by Bhim Rawal’s candidacy to the party chairperson and few others’ candidacy to other party positions4. Oli’s selections were elected for senior vice-chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, general secretary, deputy general secretary, and majority Central committee members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oli won the position of CPN-UML party chairperson for the next five years with 1,837 votes, with his competitor Rawal getting 223 votes. The General Convention mirrored the Oli’s growing cult personality and its institutionalization within the party cadres, which was demonstrated by the open moves of Oli’s cadres to forcefully restrict Rawal’s campaign at the convention site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oli’s strong disregard to democratic practice, ideological discussions or political programs in the disguise of consensus politics to appoint party officials, and his desire to be appointed as the unchallenged party president, signals his authoritarian dynamics within the party. This was already seen in UML’s regional, district and local conventions, where within-party democratic norms were halted in the name of appointing leaderships and convention representatives through consensus, largely placing Oli favored personnel in the positions. This indicates Oli’s intentional move to have sole influence in the party from the grassroots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Oli’s intend was to prepare favorable grounds for the upcoming general election among the party cadres in this convention, whose morale has highly diminished given the party spilt reducing the size of UML from the largest party and overthrowing of UML led governments from center and provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, Oli’s intention was to motivate the party cadres through the appointment of leadership positions by consensus and deliver the notion of unity and oneness for the upcoming election. However, Bhim Rawal’s fraction and other few had disagreement on Oli’s sole monopoly of appointing leadership positions and central committee members. Overall, 10th UML convention has been a step forward to consolidate Oli’s authoritarianism within the party dynamics, diverting party away from principle of collective leadership towards everything controlled by a single man, showing the signs of fascism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Protest against Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana and effects on judiciary</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Supreme Court justices, Nepal Bar Association, lawyers, youth leaders etc. demanded the resignation of Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana; at the time, justices refused to hear cases except for habeas corpus cases in protest. 18 Supreme Court justices, Nepal Bar Association, and lawyers appealed to impeach Rana. Rana sent two writ petitions to the Constitutional Court seeking stay of hearing of the writ petition against the ordinance of the Constitutional Council and the appointment as per the ordinance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, on November 16, four justices started hearing cases other than habeas corpus and refused to attend a meeting of the Nepal Bar Association and Supreme Court Bar Association who were protesting against Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana. The next day, on November 17, Nepal Bar Association gave Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana an ultimatum to resign within 72 hours. However, justices who were previously boycotting benches started attending them. Furthermore, A lottery system was put in place which will assign cases to justices. The chief justice previously used to prepare the cause list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On November 22, Nepal Bar Association took further action and urged political parties in the federal parliament and House Speaker Agni Sapkota to take action against Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana from office. However, Chief Justice Rana said that he is ready to face the constitutional process (which would result in an impeachment motion) rather than stepping down voluntarily. Furthermore, Nepali political parties haven’t shown interest in impeaching Rana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proper functioning of the judiciary has been affected by protests against the Chief Justice. The NBA and justices accused the Chief Justice of attempting to get his brother-in-law, Gajendra Hamal, who is not a member of parliament, into the Cabinet and delaying case hearings to constitutional bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it’s not the executive’s job to interfere in the judiciary’s functioning, the judiciary should comply with regulations and not hamper its service seekers. Furthermore, this action disturbs the separation of powers. The judiciary’s integrity is also compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nepali Congress’ convention and growing fractions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress General Convention is to be held from 24 December. Owing to the upcoming battle for leadership, Nepali Congress is rife with factionalism. There are two major factions in Congress led by Sher Bahadur Deuba and Ram Chandra Poudel. Shashank, Shekhar, and Sujata of the Koirala family has not still come up with a common candidate and coalition among the three does not seem to be easy, as Shekhar and Sujata both are equally interested to run for party president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rivalry between PM Sher Bahadur Deuba and Congress Vice President Bimalendra Nidhi for party presidency is ongoing, along with Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula, and Shekhar Koirala who have also announced their candidacies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deuba is attempting to convince Nidhi to cancel his presidential bid. Congress leaders said that party presidency elections will go into a second round, as in the 13th General Convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Other parties</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct 29, CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Kumar Nepal said that the five-party alliance will run in the upcoming elections as an alliance. Similarly, on Oct 30, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal also said that the five-party alliance must continue until the next elections, and he also proposed a merger between Maoist Centre and JSP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s Maoist Centre is currently a key coalition partner in the Deuba government. On November 8, a “coordination committee” was formed to support the Deuba government (an idea pitched by Dahal). Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajbadi Party, and Rastriya Janamorcha will have two members each in the committee. Observers said that Dahal wants to maintain his relevance while out of power through the committee.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Shaleen Shah', '/uploads/banner_image/1671097745_Pro-Sauraha-KTM-CPNUMLLeaderOliBandasatrae-1536x972.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-12-14', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 21:34:05', '2022-12-15 21:41:50'),

On October 5, a meeting of leaders of the ruling coalition reached a broad consensus on which party will take which ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gajendra Hamal was appointedas minister for industry, commerce and supplies. However, critics claimed that Hamal, as a non-parliamentarian, should not be appointed as minister, and that he was likely appointed on the behest of Cholendra Shumsher Rana. Hamal resigned two days after his appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a few contests on which parties would take which ministries or positions. CPN (Unified Socialist) initially demanded a position at the defence ministry but secured chief minister positions in Province 1 and Bagmati Province. The five-party alliance had decided to give the postof state minister to Janata Samajbadi Party, however, the state minister position could not be appointed to JSP because the Cabinet size has been capped to 25 members. The deputy speaker’s position is also vacant, and it is unclear which party will receive this position. The position of minister for industry, commerce and supplies is also vacant after Gajendra Hamal resigned.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Uml</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>UML’s statute congress was held from October 1-3. A document on the party’s organisational structure and a statute amendment proposal was presented during the statute congress. The Standing Committee and Central Committee endorsed the documents. Also, during the statute congress, it was proposed to removethe post of Deputy General Secretary. Currently, Ghanshyam Bhusal and Bishnu Poudel are the Deputy General Secretaries of UML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UML’s general convention is scheduled for November 18-22.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Congress</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepali Congress held city conventions in Kathmandu in 10 out of 11 municipalities. The voting process for the Nepali Congress Kathmandu Metropolitan City President and Executive Committee was held on October 3. Also on October 3, Nepali Congress concluded the conventions in local units—rural municipalities, municipalities, sub-metropolitan cities and metropolitan cities—in 64 out of 77 districts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>District conventions in the Himalayan districts were held on October 30. Of the 21 Himalayan districts, the ward convention could not be held in Dolpa and Rasuwa due to active membership disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The upcoming 14th general convention of the party is scheduled to take place on November 25-29, however, it may be delayedas some districts are yet to hold general conventions.</p>\r\n<i>Analysis:</i>\r\n\r\n<p>CPN-UML had claimed that the Deuba government was illegitimately formed, however, cabinet expansion was successful. A controversy regarding Hamal’s appointment to the ministry emerged shortly after. Critics argued that a non-parliamentarian district level officer could not be appointed as minister as it blurred lines between judiciary and executive, hence not respecting separation of powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the vacant positions of State Minister, Deputy Speaker, and Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies is creating confusion as to which party will take which position. The ruling alliance used the Deputy Speaker’s position as a bargaining chip, which critics have argued is not appropriate. The Speaker and Deputy Speaker should be elected within 15 days of the first meeting of the House of Representatives according to Article 91,</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CPN-UML’s dissatisfaction with Deuba government</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CPN-UML claimed that the new Sher Bahadur Deuba led government was illegitimately formed by splitting CPN-UML and JSP through an ordinance which eased party splits–the Ordinance on Political Parties; the ordinance was later repealed after its purpose was served. As a result, the party held obstructions in the House, thereby curtailing its proper functioning. CPN UML’s party leadership claimed that fresh elections should take place. Due to the House obstructions, over 55 bills were pending in Parliament. Similarly, an ordinance related to administration of oath registered in the Parliament on July 18 lapsed on September 15 due to UML’s House obstruction, affecting PM Deuba’s ability to induct ministers and hindering cabinet expansion. UML boycotted an all-party meeting called by Sher Bahadur Deuba, pointing out that they will not attend any meeting where CPN (Unified Socialist), CPN-UML’s splinter party, which the UML claims is ‘unconstitutionally formed’, is present. Similarly, a House of Representatives meeting scheduled for October 26 was postponed by two days because it conflicted with local level conventions of CPN-UML, delaying House functioning.</p>\r\n<i>Analysis:</i>\r\n\r\n<p>The events outlined above demonstrate how domestic party politics and conflict affects functioning of the Parliament, to the extent that bills remain pending in the House, cabinet expansion is hindered, and parliamentary meetings are delayed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Party conventions, statute congresses, and possible elections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Political parties held or planned their conventions and statute congresses this month. UML’s statute congress was held from October 1-3 and the general convention is scheduled for November 18-22. CPN-UML is scheduled to hold party conventions in wards across the country on October 20 at the lower level of the party. Nepali Congress, on October 3, concluded the conventions in local units. Their 14th general convention is scheduled for November 25-29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During UML’s statute congress, it was proposed to remove the post of Deputy General Secretary. Currently, Ghanshyam Bhusal and Bishnu Poudel are the Deputy General Secretaries of UML. Nepali Congress announced that even if it loses the general convention representative, it will be able to run for the post other than the chairperson of the district working committee. This rule will apply to districts with two or more constituencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, early elections in April-May 2022 instead of November-December 2022 is possible if the prime minister dissolves the House, however, this move is uncertain since agreement between political parties cannot be ascertained.</p>\r\n<i>Analysis:</i>\r\n\r\n<p>Successful party conventions and statute congresses mark the beginning of the formation of a stable government. However, elections slated for November-December 2022 may incur significant expenses. An Election Observation Committee’s studyshowed that in previous elections, candidates and political parties spent Rs. 131.63 billion. The government spent Rs. 34.72 billion whereas supporters spent more than Rs. 96.91 billion. There were 15,427,938 voters in the 2017 elections and each voter cost Rs. 8,492. Another study by the committee showed that each voter cost Rs. 4,923 and Rs. 69.42 billion was spent in three phases of local elections.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Shaleen Shah', '/uploads/banner_image/1671098741_ROS_KTM_SHERBDEUBA2-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-10', '2021-11-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 21:50:41', '2022-12-15 21:51:43'),

Previously, to split a political party, support of 40 percent in both the central committee and parliamentary party was required. The new ordinance enabled political party splits to occur with 20 percent support in either the central committee or the parliamentary party. Consequently, CPN-UML split, and Madhav Kumar Nepal registered a new party as CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) split and Mahanta Thakur registered a new party as Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chairman of CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli objected Election Commission’s decision to register a new party under Madhav Kumar Nepal, but the Supreme Court refused to issue an interim order. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav asserted that the Political Parties bill either to be repealed or amended before Cabinet expansion. On September 27, President Bidya Devi Bhandari repealed the ordinance on Political Parties (Second Amendment)-2078. However, actions taken under the ordinance still stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KP Oli’s faction of CPN-UML is against the ordinance and party splits. Lawmaker Devendra Dahal accused the Election Commission of creating a ‘conspiracy to weaken their party.’ Madhav Kumar Nepal’s faction of CPN (Unified Socialist) stood in support of the ordinance, fearing that repealing it may affect their newly registered party. Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) predicted another split if the ordinance isn’t repealed, so they demanded repealing the ordinance as a pre-condition for Cabinet expansion. Cabinet expansion has been delayed for over two months since Deuba became Prime Minister. Repealing the ordinance after its purpose was served (inducing party splits) may be a political maneuver.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Parliament obstruction by CPN-UML and ‘budget holiday’</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The former CPN (UML) led government under KP Oli introduced an ordinance on the Budget for the current fiscal year on May 29 and presented it in the federal parliament on July 19. The ordinance needed to be passed by September 15, within 60 days. KP Oli was removed as Prime Minister and replaced by Sher Bahadur Deuba. On September 10, the new government brought a Bill to replace the ordinance budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CPN-UML members obstructed the parliament in protest on September 15. Since Speaker Agni Sapkota required all parties’ support to endorse the Bill, it didn’t pass by the required deadline of September 15 and a ‘budget holiday’ was created, i.e., government spending was halted. CPN-UML obstructed the parliament because they had recommended removing 14 of their House of Representatives members, accusing them of colluding with Madhav Kumar Nepal’s faction and conspiring to split the party, however, Speaker Agni Sapkota, on August 29, cancelled this recommendation. CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli filed cases against Sapkota and the Election Commission, but the Supreme Court refused to issue an interim order against those charged. However, President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated the Appropriation Bill-2021 on September 23, ending the ‘budget holiday’ and resuming government spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CPN-UML’s KP Oli had introduced the Budget ordinance on May 29 and presented it to the federal parliament on July 19 when he was the Prime Minister. Now that CPN-UML has become the opposition party to Sher Bahadur Deuba’s Congress led government, and Speaker Sapkota denied their request of expelling 14 allegedly defecting lawmakers. This led UPN-UML to obstruct the parliament. This shows that their motive for parliament obstruction was political rather than the content of the budget. Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal were also among the 14 recommended by CPN-UML to be expelled. However, Agni Sapkota, as the House Speaker, has the authority to cancel this recommendation. The failure of the Bill to replace the Budget ordinance caused, for the first time in Nepal’s history, a ‘budget holiday’. This scenario can be described as a case of domestic political rivalry causing delays in parliamentary procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hearings on constitutional appointments in limbo</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The judiciary was rocked by allegations that the Chief Justice failed to ensure separation of powers and avoid conflicts of interests. A debate arose about whether the Chief Justice needs to be present in the Constitutional Bench. On September 2, Justice Hari Phuyal issued an interim order demanding this debate to be settled, however, this issue has not been resolved. Hearings on cases against constitutional appointments are in limbo because of this unresolved issue.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Shaleen Shah', '/uploads/banner_image/1671099299_PRO_KTM_RSS_011.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-09', '2021-10-11', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 21:59:59', '2022-12-15 21:59:59'),

Previously, provisions of the Political Parties Act-2017 said that if a party has control over 40 percent of its Central Committee and Parliamentary Party members, then it can register a new party. The ordinance changed 40 percent to 20 percent and the clause in the provision from “and” to “or.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, after the ordinance was promulgated, the CPN-UML (UML led by KP Sharma Oli) split as Madhav Kumar Nepal applied for Communist Party of Nepal Unified Marxist Leninist (Ekikrit Samajbadi), a new party, at the Election Commission. Furthermore, the Janata Samajbadi Party also split after Mahantha Thakur registered a new party under the name of Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. Later, on August 19, 2021, as many as six writ petitions were filed at the Supreme Court against the ordinance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consequently, the Parliament now has six political parties–Nepali Congress, Janata Samajbadi Party, the Maoist Centre, Loktantriik Samajbadi Party (LSP), and CPN (Unified Socialist). Rastriya Prajantra Party, Rastriya Janamorcha, and Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party are not recognized as national parties, and they are represented by one lawmaker each. Experts noted that as UML has split, the Nepal led faction will support the Deuba government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Thakur faction hasn’t yet decided about joining the government. Upendra Yadav and Baburam Bhattarai’s JSP is aiming to have an electoral alliance with the Maoist Centre. Thakur’s LSP will likely contest with the JSP as both parties’ constituencies are in the Madhes region. It is uncertain whether Congress and LSP will create an electoral alliance. Since Oli and Dahal have disagreements, alliances between the UML and Maoist Centre is unlikely and alliances between Nepal and Dahal is more likely. On August 29, Madhav Kumar Nepal was elected as the Parliamentary Party leader of CPN (Unified Socialist).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the Deuba government’s Cabinet expansion is still in the pipeline. According to the Election Commission’s timeline, this is likely to occur after August 25 after Madhav Nepal’s party is registered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CPN-UML had recommended stripping 14 of its House of Representatives from their positions citing that they were planning to split the party. However, Agni Sapkota, on August 29, decided to not carry out this action since they have already formed a new party. Furthermore, on September 2, KP Oli had filed three writ petitions at the Supreme Court to issue an interim order to the Election Commission to invalidate the registration of a new party, CPN (Unified Socialist), under Madhav Kumar Nepal, however, the Supreme Court under a bench of Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana refused to fulfill Oli’s request.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Governance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 58th annual report of the Auditor General, published on August 19, presented to President Bidya Devi Bhandari on August 21, outlines several issues with governance pertinent to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Problems with governance in Covid-19 management and procurement of medical goods,</li>\r\n	<li>Issues with policies of supply and distribution of goods,</li>\r\n	<li>Expense of public funds and</li>\r\n	<li>Issues with financial audits</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These issues with governance will be analyzed and discussed in this paper citing possible solutions and recommendations towards the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Issues with Governance in Covid-19 Management and Equipment Procurement</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Auditor General’s ‘Special Audit Report on Covid-19 Management’ outlines problems with management during the Covid-19 outbreak and issues with procurement of medical goods during the outbreak. The report outlines that although Covid-19 was first detected in Nepal towards the end of January in 2020, the government created a risk assessment and action plan only four months later in May 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Omni Business Corporate received the purchase order to procure equipment such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), protective goggles, and testing kits even after quoting 13.9 percent higher rate than other suppliers. In April 2020, the government cancelled this contract with Omni Business Corporate. Although the Department of Health Services’ cost estimate for procuring medical equipment was $9.07 million, Omni’s proposal quoted $10.03 million. The auditor general’s report asks why it was awarded to the now blacklisted Omni Business Corporate in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the federal, provincial, and local governments had lapses in coordination while handling quarantine centers in the border points of southern Nepal. People moved across borders, went missing from quarantine centers, but the authorities didn’t take proper measures to curtain these events, citing that they didn’t have enough equipment and funds to run the centers effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report outlines that the government took up responsibility to conduct antigen tests, but due to lack of equipment and human resources, the tests didn’t take place until July 2020. Furthermore, there were delays in the medical equipment procurement process. The Department of Health Services started the procurement process only on April 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report stated that, as per section 71 of the Public Procurement Act-2007, a procurement committee cannot be formed under the chief advisor of the Health Minister (which was the situation)–instead, the chief of a concerned public entity or a senior officer nominated by the chief should head such a committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Issues with governance in procurement of agricultural goods</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Auditor General’s report cited that the government had lapses in policies regarding the supply and distribution of agricultural equipment such as chemical fertilizers, creating problems for farmers. The report said that although the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development estimated that there is an annual demand of approximately 600,000 tonnes of fertilizers, this estimate is outdated and there haven’t been studies to find out the current demand. Spokesperson for the Agriculture Inputs Company, Bishnu Prasad Pokharel, said that the current demand is over 1.1 million tonnes, and there is a supply of only 400,000 tonnes. Nepal imported 366,794 tonnes in 338 days in 2018, and 358,086 tonnes in 253 days this year. There were also delays in the supply period of fertilizers, averaging 224 days, even though contractors are given</p>\r\n\r\n<p>70 days. The Auditor General’s report says that the government needs to carry out studies in this sector and set up proper policies and strategies to resolve these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Issues with governance in management of public funds seen through financial audits</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Office of the Auditor General’s 58th annual report contains information from audits of 5,462 public offices and institutions. The report states that out of the Rs. 5.33 trillion which was audited, 12.69 percent, or Rs. 644.4 billion, is “yet to be updated, or unsettled.” Furthermore, Rs. 418.85 billion (Rs. 104.38 billion last fiscal year) has been considered as ‘beruju’ or irregular amount, meaning “such a transaction indicated or found on audit as a transaction carried on without fulfilling such requirements as to be fulfilled in accordance with the prevailing law or a transaction of which such accounting as to be maintained has not been maintained or a transaction which has been carried on in an irregular or unreasonable manner”, according to Section 2(r) of the Financial Procedures Act 1999. This ‘beruju’ or irregular amount is 2.86 percent of the federal expenses, 2.74 percent of the provincial expenses, and 5 percent of the local government expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusions and recommendations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The issues in governance outlined in the 58th annual report of the Office of the Auditor General show lapses in accountability in public administration in different areas such as procurement of medical goods, management of quarantine centers, procurement of agricultural goods, and management of public funds. Such issues have been seen to be added in the Office of the Auditor General’s reports every year, but efforts to resolve these issues have been scarce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Public Procurement Act 2007 is meant to resolve problems with procurement of goods and services, even after being amended 10 times, the Act’s effects are still not ideal. Furthermore, only one Public Procurement Management Office in Kathmandu is not enough to oversee public procurements of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although political parties, the CIAA, concerned government agencies, federal ministries and related agencies should work towards resolving the issues outlined in the Auditor General’s report, actions by these actors have been scarce.

On July 12, the Supreme Court (SC) reinstated the House of Representatives (HoR), which had been dissolved by the then Prime Minister (PM) KP Oli—for the second time in a row. Quashing Oli’s authoritarian ambition, the court interpreted some unclear provisions of the constitutions, including the Article 76.5; the SC’s verdict explained that the article’s purpose was to ensure the longevity of the HoR and that under the Article 76.5, individual lawmakers were free to align and vote for anyone they pleased. Party’s whip would not work in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, the trend of outsourcing political disputes and questions to the courts and other constitutional bodies has grown. Due to a polarization in personal interests of the leaders, factionalism and disputes seem to have plagued all the parties. When the parties and leaders fail to resolve their disputes by themselves, they seek the outside counsel. The Supreme Court’s involvement was also the result of similar dynamics. However, the court’s verdict was historic; not only did it restore the supremacy of the constitution by thwarting Oli’s anti-democratic moves but it also explained the constitutional provisions related to government formation, which will have a long-term impact in Nepali politics. Nevertheless, the by-product of Deuba’s appointment as the PM has been observed within all political parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CPN-UML: the Opposition</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Oli tried to influence the court’s decision and save his chair by doing all he could. On June 30, he had ‘revived’ the old Central Committee and scrapped the convention organizing committee. He wanted the 23 lawmakers to withdraw their signatures from the Supreme Court’s petition against him. Oli still had Mahant Thakur’s support, which made him believe that he could still muster a majority against the rival alliance if the Madhav Nepal faction complied. Oli also had the sympathy of the second-rank UML leaders who were more concerned about saving the party’s unity because a party split would jeopardize their future. However, Madhav Nepal maintained his rigidity and declined to withdraw the signatures, despite intense negotiations and a task force-drafted 10-point deal for agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When all else failed, Oli retorted to his usual tactics of intimidation. The party’s standing committee (Oli group) meeting on July 16 decided not to offer vote of confidence to Deuba and ‘unilaterally’ endorsed the 10-point agreement, but that did not work either; 22 UML lawmakers voted in Deuba’s favor and 11 decided to stay absent—‘violating’ the party’s whip. A furious Oli responded with personal attacks against Madhav Nepal and others who had cost him his chair. However, in subsequent days, he toned down his aggression and instead expressed a desire to continue reconciliation efforts until the end. In the process, Oli even offered to make Madhav Nepal the party’s second chairperson, but Madhav Nepal was dismissive of Oli’s offer. While the former wanted to maintain his grip over the party, the latter was not willing to buzz with anything other than an equal and ‘dignified’ co-chairmanship of the party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oli’s initial remarks at Nepal’s firmness was full of contempt. He accused him of being arrogant and even called him a ‘traitor’ who had no place in the party. Many would see such remarks as a result of Oli’s growing helplessness and a diminishing grip over the party. Meanwhile, Madhav Nepal has indicated that he will not be joining the government and would rather continue his struggle in the party. His position seems to be guided by three factors: a) the pressure from second-rank leaders to save the party’s unity, b) an understanding that his clout in the party is gradually increasing with Oli’s downfall, and c) an attachment to the party’s flag and electoral symbol. Oli is not unaware of his shrinking influence in the party either, which is why a ‘compromise’ to allow Madhav Nepal an equal chairmanship appears more likely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UML’s unfolding internal politics, the revival of ‘violent’ youth wings by both Oli and Nepal factions have been particularly interesting. When the Oli faction revived the party’s ‘Youth Force,’ the Nepal faction also decided to revive the People’s Volunteer (PV), which had been dissolved after the party’s eighth general convention. During the ‘power demonstration rallies,’ Mahesh Basnet, Oli’s close aide, did not shy away from making inflammatory threats and warnings. The nature and timing of such remarks indicate Oli’s defensive strategy to warn the coalition government not to take any action against his appointees, the accomplices in his unconstitutional moves, including the president, and his associates embroiled in corruption scandals. This paranoia begs an important question regarding the autonomy of the constitutional bodies including the Election Commission (EC) and the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). Why do these autonomous bodies tend to be pro-state? Why and how do the EC and the CIAA, which apparently worked in Oli’s favor until a month ago, suddenly become pro-government (Deuba) again? Perhaps the answer lies in heavy politicization of the commissions and commissioners’ concern about saving their jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Madhes-based party suffered a direct blow from the ‘Oli debacle.’ After the NCP’s split, when he lost the Maoist Centre’s support, Oli asked the JSP to join the government. Lured by Oli’s promise to address the Madhes issues, Mahant Thakur faction of the JPS joined the government, while the Yadav-Bhattarai faction continued the anti-Oli alliance. However, the Thakur faction’s support fell short when the Madhav Nepal group decided to favor Deuba. Now that Oli is gone and Deuba is the PM, the Thakur faction has not only lost the power and leverage to get the Madhes issues addressed but is also gradually losing supporters. Five lawmakers from the Thakur faction joined the Yadav faction, giving the latter a comfortable majority at both Central Working Committee (CWC) and parliamentary party. On July 26, the Election Commission (EC) decided that the Yadav faction, with a majority CWC members, had the legitimate claim over the party. Meanwhile, Thakur was given an option to register a new party. Whereas Thakur has challenged the EC’s decision at the Supreme Court, the party’s CWC meeting decided to strip the positions of all 16 members of the Thakur faction, limiting the party’s CWC to 34 members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JSP’s genesis was a result of Oli’s ambition, while its split was once again a direct by-product of Oli’s power games. Not that Thakur’s Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP) and Yadav’s Samajwadi Party were natural allies, but their merger had consolidated a number strong enough to influence decisions in the federal parliament. However, personal rivalries and misplaced priorities ended up splitting the party. What the episode also exposed is the leaders’ and lawmakers’ lack of commitment to their ideologies and hunger for power –factional switching with the hope of being ministers is just one evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nepali Congress and CPN-Maoist Centre</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither the Nepali Congress nor the Maoist Centre is safe from the lawmakers’ unhealthy competition to become minister. While Madhav Nepal’s decision not to join the government does offer some clarity and gives more room to accommodate the three parties—Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, and Janata Samajwadi Party—in the government, intra-party competition and rivalries continue to delay cabinet expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At an event, the Maoist Centre chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal shared that he was under a lot of stress because all 49 lawmakers from the party wanted to be ministers. Likewise, PM Deuba, who has the party’s general convention knocking its door, faces his own challenge to distribute the ministerial portfolios among different factions within his party. Given the imbalance of aspirants and available portfolios, the parties are likely to make settlements through political and diplomatic appointments—one major source of politicization of autonomous bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Seizing the Moment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ongoing intra-party wrangling, the pandemic mismanagement, and corruption scandals have all evidently frustrated the general public. Apart from the parties’ internal disputes for power and leadership, public discontent also lies in the evolving state-party relationship. Oli’s unilateral actions and complete control over both party and the government had blurred the boundaries between the two. Although Deuba may not share Oli’s authoritarian tendencies, his governance track record is no cleaner. Besides, his few moves in the first three weeks of his appointment indicate his failure to distance the government from crony capitalists and make the most of the opportunity Nepali politics brought him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to capture this political vacuum created by public frustration are conservative, anti-democratic forces. For instance, Bibeksheel Sajha Party’s chief Rabindra Mishra shared a proposal, calling for a referendum on secularism and scrapping federalism. The proposal stirred an intra-party scuffle, with the party’s coordinator Milan Pandey clarifying that Mishra’s proposal was his personal stand, not the party’s official statement. While Mishra’s proposal was only an opportunistic move in an effort to gain relevance in the mainstream politics, anti-democratic aspirations and voices should neither be overlooked nor underestimated. After all, Nepal’s federal democratic republic is a joint achievement of all the parties and people, which should be defended by all.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, NULL, '/uploads/banner_image/1671100446_PRO_KTM-96501-scaled-1-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-07', '2021-08-17', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 22:19:06', '2022-12-15 22:19:06');

The court’s last few decisions— be it against his Cabinet expansion, his unilateral efforts to seize the party, or the Citizenship Ordinance—offer Oli a legitimate cause of concern for his political future. With most of his unconstitutional efforts curtailed so far, Oli’s faith in the Supreme Court to uphold his House dissolution move appears to have shaken. Owing to that realization, perhaps, he has made moves, although half-hearted and somewhat deceitful, to court the disgruntled Madhav Nepal group back in the party. One such move was Oli’s unilateral ‘scrapping up’ of the illegitimate 10th General Convention Organizing Committee on June 30. Although some leaders claim that the move creates a favorable environment for an agreement between the two factions, Oli’s intentions and the factions’ current political realities tell otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, Oli had issued a six-point deal, committing to return to May 17, 2018, if the 23 lawmakers who challenged his House dissolution move and supported Deuba’s bid to be the prime minister withdrew their signatures. However, the Nepal faction quickly declined the proposal, accusing it of yet another ploy. The SC’s decisions on June 10 and 22 as well as the ongoing SC hearing against his House dissolution move all led Oli to make a more drastic move; through ‘the final meeting’ of the 10th General Convention Organizing Committee, he scrapped it up and called a Central Committee meeting on July 2. Interestingly, the meeting also inducted former Maoist leaders, who defected Maoist Centre and joined Oli after NCP’s split, into CPN-UML’s Standing Committee. The Central Committee that the meeting revived was also the 241-member Committee extended for the unification, not the original with 203 elected members. Besides these dissatisfactions, the Nepal group called the Central Committee meeting summoned by an illegitimate structure illegal and decided not to attend it. With Oli’s somewhat weakened position, second-rank leaders from both the factions continue to facilitate an agreement and save the party unity. However, both factions have difficult questions and realities to face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PM Oli wants the Nepal faction to withdraw their signatures from the sub judice House dissolution case. This is important for Oli because the withdrawal would undo the anti-Oli majority and complicate the court hearing. So even if the SC restored the House, Deuba would not be appointed the prime minister. In fact, the court could redirect Oli to first exhaust Article 76.4 of the Constitution, according to which PM Oli would have to seek confidence in the parliament. With a united CPN-UML and the support from JSP’s Thakur faction, Oli may once again be the prime minister—constitutionally. However, Oli’s condition is not easy for the Nepal faction to fulfill. Madhav Nepal has repeatedly stressed his commitment to the opposition alliance; deserting the alliance and siding with Oli would put moral and ethical questions on him and his faction. The faction’s political reality is different, though. Splitting from the CPN-UML and establishing a new party is neither a politically practical option nor a priority for Nepal. He understands the risk of splitting from the party, where he has had a long legacy. Therefore, an Oli-Nepal compromise is a necessity for both; only the terms of understanding are divergent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spillover of the communist politics appears to have created two clear losing groups, as of yet. The first is the Mahant Thakur group of Janata Samajwadi Party. Committed to getting their demands fulfilled, the group defied the party’s majority and joined the Oli government. They succeeded to get some Madhes/Tharuhat-movement cases withdrawn. However, their major demands, including the Citizenship Amendment Ordinance, release of their lawmaker Resham Chaudhary, and Constitutional Amendment, were all put on hold by the Supreme Court. Now, the faction is embroiled in a protracted legal battle with its rival faction. The faction’s political future hinges on the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission, after which it will have to decide whether or not to continue the alliance with PM Oli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another losing group is the former Maoist leaders, who chose to side with Oli when the SC decision split the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party (NCP) into CPN-UML and Maoist Centre. These leaders, who lost their ministerial portfolios, are now fighting for their identity and position in the CPN-UML. While Oli’s moves indicate his intention to reward their allegiance by giving them ‘respectable’ positions in the party, the Nepal faction has displayed its strong reservation against Oli’s unilateral attempts to do so. As it appears, the former Maoist leaders may have to settle with little. On the other hand, Dahal’s Maoist Centre is facing its own challenges of strengthening the party and guiding the opposition alliance, which is weakened by Nepal faction’s temptation to return to the party and Nepali Congress’ internal issues. The largest opposition party that is leading the anti-Oli coalition is now distracted by its upcoming general convention and factional politics, which has gained new dimensions. Initially, a three-faction party—led by Deuba, Poudel, and Situala— appears headed towards a possible reconfiguration of the party equation. While Bimalendra Nidhi has decided to challenge his long-time companion Deuba, Ram Chandra Poudel, Dr. Shekhar Koirala, Dr. Shashank Koirala, and Prakash Man Singh have all expressed their will to run for party president. Besides the internal disputes regarding active membership distribution, therefore, a budding alliance among Nidhi, Singh, and Dr. Shashank Koirala, has kept everyone curious, anticipating, and busy.</p>', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Mahesh Kumar Kushwaha', '/uploads/banner_image/1671359851_default-img.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-06', '2021-07-13', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 22:29:14', '2022-12-18 22:22:31'),

Province 2 government had tried several times to collect the majority in the provincial assembly, but the lack of consensus among the parties failed to come up with a provincial name. However, this time, 80 provincial members out of 90 voted in favor of ‘Madhes’ while 78 votes were cast in favor of Janakpur as capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the vote, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, CPN-Maoist Centre, as well as the opposition, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LOSPA) jointly supported the naming of Madhes Province. Despite being the opposition party in Madhes Province, LOSPA has supported the ruling party’s main agenda of identity-based rights. While Nepal Congress party had proposed provincial name ‘Mithila-Bhojpura’, CPN-Unified Socialist party and main opposition CPN-UML had jointly proposed provincial name ‘Janaki.’ However, Province 2 was named Madhes by two-thirds after receiving enough support from the leaders of the main opposition—CPN-UML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The naming of the province courted criticism as people argued that provincial names could not be retained based on identity. Province 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 had been named as Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim respectively, based on names of rivers and historical places. However, identity-based politics is one of the important aspects of Nepal’s federalism. The identity-based provincial name, Madhes Province represents the people’s identity, society, and culture which reflects the real practice of identity-based federalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Debate over the name of Madhes Province</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While most Madhesi people and political leaders have welcomed the name of the province, it has invited mixed reactions from opinion makers, social media, civil society, and political leaders. Madhes Province even declared a public holiday on January 18 to celebrate the naming of the province. According to analysts, Madhesis have accepted the provincial name as a partial achievement from Madhes movements. The Madhesi community had organized the Madhes movement in different stages (as the first, second, and third movements in 2007, 2008, and 2015 respectively) for better recognition and representation of their identity. Thus, Madhes-based political leaders have also accepted the becoming of Madhes Province as a by-product of the Madhes movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Madhes, One Pradesh (Ek Madhesh, Ek Pradesh) had been the agenda of Madhes-based political parties since the first Madhes Movement in 2007. However, the agenda had been abandoned due to interparty tension among Madhes based parties and leaders. Similarly, in 2015, the demand for ‘One Madhes Two Pradesh’ began to gain ground amidst protests against the newly promulgated constitution which resulted in the carving out of two provinces in Madhes—one from Jhapa to Parsa and another from Chitwan to Kanchanpur. Tharu people and leaders had also demanded a separate Tharuwan Province in western Nepal during the 2015 protests, and the Tikapur incident. However, Tharus still await their justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While, some politicians from Madhes claim that the naming of the Madhes Province is an achievement in giving the sense of implementation of federalism. However, other Madhesi leaders say that the agenda of a Madhes movement was to have a province represent Madhesis of the 22 districts. They say that the fight for such a province shrunk 14 districts and then to only eight which caused greater damage politically and geographically.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Poor Capital Budget Expenditure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has spent the lowest capital budget of 13.44 percent in past six months compared to the last three fiscal years. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance, Janardhan Sharma’s announcement to spend 10% capital budget in the first three months and then 10% each month at any cost triggered debates but the government failed to meet even half of its target. Despite Minister Sharma’s attempts to gather with other minsters several times for an effective budget implementation, the government has failed to spend capital budget due to delayed implementation, budget holidays, and political tension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The budget implementation has also been affected by the delays in the formation of the provincial cabinets due to political instability. All seven provincial governments have been taking a long time for cabinet expansion due to government changes in the last two to three months. For instance, Karnali provincial government has not yet been able to expand the cabinet. Despite, Jeevan Bahadur Shahi being appointed as Chief Minister on November 3, 2021, Karnali Province is still depending on the centre for the cabinet expansion. Prior to his appointment, the position lay vacant for a long period of time which has also impacted the budget expenditure and effective governance. The lack of proper budget implementation harms development sectors, which requires the attention of the leaders, representatives, government, and other concerned bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has expressed concern over the growing corruption and irregularities in the country. The commission has received the highest number of corruption and irregularities-related complaints from the local government. In the fiscal year 2020-21, the commission had received 14,425 such complaints. The CIAA also claimed that most of the local level resources are mobilized by the consumer committees. Thus, pointing out that one of the major causes of increase in irregularities was from the consumer committees. Recently, a team of the CIAA raided Pipara Rural Municipality of Mahottari, from where the commission had received 32 complaints about irregularities. This is an example of a local level corruption. However similar corruption and irregularities are found in all tiers of the government, adversely affecting the economy of the country. Furthermore, lack of proper monitoring of staffs and local representatives’ is also a cause for rampant corruption.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671102037_AKS_DHANUSA_JASAPA-1536x1153.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-01', '2022-02-24', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 22:45:08', '2022-12-15 22:45:37'),

Although, all the seven provinces have instituted important laws (like the Provincial Police Act, Provincial Public Service Commission, Provincial Civil Service, and Employees Adjustment Act), the centralized mindset and lack of accountability in the leaders and federal bureaucrats, pose a challenge. For example, Province 2 filed five writ petitions against the federal government accusing it of encroaching on the provincial government’s jurisdiction. Considerable evidence exists of the central government trying to interfere with the Sagarnath Forest Development Project, Forest Act, Employees Adjustment Act, and Provincial Police Act, even if, schedule 6 in the constitution affirms that the provincial government’s right to these areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government also failed to endorse e provincial laws. Province 2 endorsed Provincial Police Act without waiting for the Federal Police Act, but the provincial government did not enact the existing laws, due to lack of consensus in the political parties. The federal raised difficulty in formulating the provincial bills, Provincial Police Act and Provincial Public Service Commission, and had to support the provincial government in forming the laws. As a consequence, the government has failed to implement their rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meetings of the Inter-State Council were also held only twice, in December 2018 and April 2019 in the five-year tenure of the election. The government had to work as a bridge between the federal and provincial governments’ functions through the Council. But former PM Oli and PM Deuba did not create positive vibes through the Council meetings in 2021. The Council meeting has thus been affected due to lack of political consensus and the major political parties preoccupied with their general conventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the seven provinces still don’t have their names and permanent capitals, although only six months remain of the electoral firm. Consensus among the political parties is yet to be reached in Provinces 1 and 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Provincial Governments have somehow succeeded to form a member of laws in 2021. Province 2 set up an Investigation Bureau for investigation of criminal incidents. Province 2 inaugurated and Agriculture University focused on the induction of the Technical University. Local Governments started an online payment system. Bagmati Province also announced a Common Minimum Program targeting COVID-19 control. But weak coordination of the bodies concerned hampers implementation of policies and laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Frequent Changes of CMs and Governor</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, the implementation of federalism got delayed after Oli’s move to dissolve the parliament. Nepali Congress and other four parties, which form the main coalition party, were mainly responsible for filing a vote of no-confidence motion nine times against KP Oli’s government in Province 1 by Chief Ministers Sher Dhan Rai and Bhim Acharya; in Bagmati by Chief Minister Dormani Paudel and Asta Laxmi Shakya; in Gandaki by Chief Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung; and in Lumbini Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel between January 2 and September 26 and Oli lost his government one by one in the six provinces including at the federal level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All provinces then also went through a vote of confidence motion after the party-split in 2021. The frequent changes of the chief ministers and votes of confidence affected the administration in the provinces. From June to November, the political parties were found playing a game for the distribution of power-sharing. This year, more than two chief ministers were appointed in Provinces 1 and Bagmati and the CM in Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali were changed twice. Such practices contribute to unstable governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frequent changes in the role of provincial governors also impacted the provincial assemblies’ function. From February 19 to November 8, President Bhandari, on the recommendation of the government replaced new governors in all the seven provinces. The central government has been using the governors as a political weapon and some of them were changed more than twice abruptly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all the provinces took a long time in cabinet expansion after the government change. The coalition government led by PM Deuba could expand his cabinet after 87, days on October 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Split Provincial Ministries</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Except for Province 1 and Sudhurpaschim, all provincial governments have split ministries for the distribution of power-sharing. However, the provincial governments are facing a lack of employees before increasing ministries, and now more difficult is its function after the increase. At present, there stands 69 provincial ministries across the country. According to the Ministry of Federal Affairs, the provincial governments have split the ministries without conducting an organization and management due to which they are not able to send the required number of employees. Such a split in the provincial ministries has continued to hamper the smooth functioning of provincial and local government, whilst also increasing the financial expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Poor Capital Budget Expenditure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not new that the government has yet again failed to expend a proper share of the capital budget, most of which will get spent at the end of the fiscal year. In the fiscal year 2020-21, the government’s capital expenditure stood at just 65 percent, including a large capital budget was spent in a week. Like every year, this year too, the government emphasized more upon the Asadhe Bikash (capital expenditure at the end of the fiscal year).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, in this current fiscal year 2021-22, the government spent just 6.46 capital budget in five months. This is the lowest capital expenditure compared to the last three fiscal years in the same time duration. While the government had announced to implement at least 10% by the first three months, and 10% each month following the capital budget at any cost. According to the government’s announcement, it should have been able to spend at least 40 percent of the capital budget. But due to the political and law barrier, the government has spent poor capital budget expenditure said the Finance Minister Janardhan Sharma, vice-chair of National Planning Commission Biswanath Paudel, and Finance Secretary Madhu Kumar Marasini. This is also a signal that the ruling alliance government tend to repeat the Asadhe Bikash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, according to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration (MOFAGA), eight local governments (5 municipalities and 3 rural municipalities) in Province 2 have not brought the budget so far of the current fiscal year 2020/21. Only two months have left for the fiscal year to end. However, compared to the previous years, the number of local bodies submitting and passing the budget on the time has been gradually increasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all provinces including the federal government led by Oli brought the budget through an ordinance in the fiscal year 2021-22. Due to the political disagreement, the ruling government was obliged to unveil the budget through the ordinance. But the same thing happened when the coalition party’s administration in four provinces (Province 1, Bagmati, Lumbini, and Gandaki) including the federal government revised the budget through the Replacement bill in all seven provinces including federal. That means both governments – Oli and Deuba tried to manipulate the budget. This is the last tenure before the election, the Deuba government like Oli government seems to have unveiled the budget as with an election-orientation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The constitution of Nepal has made several provisions for equitable distribution of resources among governments entities considering inter-governmental fiscal transfer as one of the significant components of fiscal federalism. For the same, The National Natural Resource and Fiscal Commission (NNRFC) was established. However, Dr. Rudra Sharma, an expert on fiscal federalism stated that the central government is intrinsically hegemonies over the province and local government, consequently, affecting the implementation of Fiscal Federalism. The Ministry of Finance has limited rights to the NNRFC. For effective implementation of the budget, the government has to revise the procurement laws, policies and budget expenditure system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 29, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has raided the office of the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers in Province 2. A team of CIAA has alleged that Province 2 has been involved in irregularities in bicycles purchases under the campaign ‘Beti Bachau-Beti Padhau’ (Educate Daughter, Save Daughter). Meanwhile, CM Raut has stated that the raiding of CIAA in the chief minister’s office discredits federalism and the provincial government. CM also said there are no irregularities and arrears-related activities from the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the effective implementation of federalism is a critical lack of coordination among the governments. At present, several challenges appear such as coordination, law formation, and implementation, COVID-19 control, functioning of bodies. The people have hoped from the upcoming election for new candidates and effective functioning of the government bodies. Federalism is still unsettled in the country; still, three tiers of government are struggling with the implementation of federalism for the formation of law and its practice. In the last year, the political parties were highly engaged in the power control, which affects the locals as well. Previously, CPN-UML had secured a comfortable majority in six of the seven provinces. At present, Nepali Congress, Maoist Center, and CPN-US had led in six provinces, with each party having two provinces, and Janata Samajbati Party ruling in the remaining Province 2. Now leaders are busy with the election-based work but lack the consensus between the Election Commission and the political parties, which is likely to affect the upcoming election.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671102661_HB_Gandaki_8368-1490x1536.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-01', '2022-03-09', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 22:56:01', '2022-12-15 22:56:01'),

On November 1, Chief Minister of Province 1, Bhim Acharya resigned after only 68 days of administration. CM Acharya had replaced Sherdhan Rai to save the CPN-UML government in Province 1. However, Acharya obliged to resign as he had been pushed into the minority after senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal withdrew from CPN-UML and formed (Unified Socialist) CPN-US. After Acharya’s resignation, Rajendra Rai, now a CPN-US leader, was again appointed as CM. He won the vote of confidence in the provincial assembly on November 17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, on November 8 Rajendra Pandey, who was appointed as the CM of Bagmati Province on October 28, also won the vote of confidence. Pandey had replaced Asta Laxmi Shakya, who was obliged to resign after the split of the CPN-UML government. Rajendra Pandey is expected to leave his post as CM after half of tenure to an NC candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CPN-US and NC have agreed on gentleman’s agreement to hold the post of CM of Bagmati Province for half of a term. Thus, as per the gentleman’s agreement, NC leader and CM Jeevan Bahadur Shahi was appointed on November 3. Such practice is a sign to an unstable government which in turn hampers the administrative work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Constantly Changing Provincial Government</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the election beginning from the end of November, Chief Ministers of Provinces 1 and Bagmati have been changed three times whilst two times in Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali Provinces. The remaining two Chief Ministers of Sudurpaschim and Province 2 were made to take the vote a confidence after the collapse of the coalition government. The politics in the center impacted in the province, rendering the provincial administration to get sidelined as leaders were busy in the politics of power sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Delay Cabinet Expansion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, a five-party alliance is governing the seven provinces. There is no sign of stability as coalition government has been trapped in the distribution of power-sharing. It is inevitable that the cabinet formation under his leadership will be delayed as it was in his predecessor, Mahendra Bahadur Shahi’s leadership. So far, CM Jeevan Bahadur Shahi has only appointed least Ministers for his cabinet portfolio. On November 1, Chief Minister of Karnali, Mahendra Bahadur Shahi resigned from his post to be succeeded by Nepali Congress leader, Jeevan Bahadur Shahi as per the gentleman’s agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all the CMs of the provincial governments have reshuffled their cabinet portfolios several times. The governments in Provinces 1 and Bagmati is suffering a blow to their provincial functioning due to a delay in cabinet expansion. CM Rai of Province 1 is preparing to split three ministries for the distribution of power-sharing. Earlier, CM Prithvi Subba Gurung in Gandaki Province had also split the ministries to balance the power-sharing. Such repeated reshuffle in the provincial cabinet has continued to hamper the smooth functioning of provincial and local government, whilst also increasing the financial expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Effect in the budget implementation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Finance Comptroller General Office (FCGO), the government has spent the capital budget of 4.5% only during the first quarter. While the government had announced to implement at least 10% by the first three months, and 10% each month following, of the capital budget at any cost. But, the ruling government is spending poorer capital budget than the previous government. While the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration has been able to spend less than 5% of the capital budget during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only the federal government, but the provincial government has also poor capital budget implementation. For example, Karnali Province has spent 4.83% of the capital budget in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. While other provinces have the same status in the budget implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the minister for the Economic Affairs and Planning of Province 1, Indra Bahadur Angboo is preparing to revise the previous budget through the Replacement Bill at the time of implementation. While, Gandaki, and Lumbini Province has already revised their budget when the government changed. The practice might change the practice of manipulating the budget for their leader interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The activities of the federal and provincial government in turn affects the citizens. At present, the people are awaiting the election with a hope of a stability in the country’s political scenario. However, with the past and present track record of the leaders and parties, can the citizens hope for a better scenario?</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671102896_DRS-sindhupalchok-2.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-12-14', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 22:59:56', '2022-12-15 23:10:34'),

A support of the five-party alliances to Deuba was appointed as the PM on July 13. There were only six members in the cabinet including PM, before a full-shape was given. Now it has reached 25, including 22 ministers and three ministers of state in the Deuba cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, this is the first time in the history of Nepali politics, the PM has not been able to expand the cabinet for such a long period. The delay in cabinet expansion has had several impacts on the day-to-day functioning of the administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not only the central government that took a long time in the cabinet expansion, Chief Minister of Lumbini Province, Kul Prasad KC’s administration took two months in the cabinet expansion. CM KC on October 10 formed a 17-member cabinet. However, he was appointed as CM on August 12. During the formation of cabinet, CM KC added seven new ministers and three state ministers.The power-sharing of central government affected the provincial government which in turn delayed the cabinet expansion both in the central and provincial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The vote of confidence in the provincial government</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Minister of Province 2 Lalbabu Raut on October 6 won the vote of confidence in the Provincial Assembly. CM Raut sought the vote of confidence as per the constitutional provision after the split of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N). Out of 104-members in the Provincial Assembly, CM Raut received 77 votes whilst as many as 23 votes against him, and four lawmakers remained absent. CM Raut got support from the JSP-N, Nepali Congress, and CPN-Unified Socialist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Province 1 and Bagmati Province also required a vote of confidence as per the constitution provision following the split of the ruling party. CPN-UML Vice-chair Asta Laxmi Shakya in Bagmati and Bhim Acharya in Province 1 were appointed as CMs on August 18 and 26 respectively. Both CMs have been suffering into the minority when the ruling party split into two parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On October 27, Bagmati CM Shakya submitted her resignation to Provincial Chief Yadav Chandra Sharma. CM Shakya confirmed that she did not win the vote of confidence from the Provincial Assembly and she decided to resign. Meanwhile, the parliamentary party leader of the CPN-US, Rajendra Pandey was appointed on October 28 as CM of Bagmati Province. Recently, the new CM Pandey formed a four-member cabinet. And as per the constitutional provision, CM Pandey also needs to seek the vote of confidence within 1 month of his appointment. As coalition government, CM Pandey has a good chance of winning the vote of confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, despite being a minority, Province 1 Chief Minister Bhim Acharya on October 24 was ready to take the vote of confidence in the Provincial Assembly. The Provincial Assembly secretariat adjourned the Provincial Assembly meeting for October 31 after the main opposition Nepali Congress demanded to postpone after signaling to cross the floor. While the ruling CPN-UML had also requested the Speaker to postpone the meeting till October 30 as the party’s Local Convection (Palika Sammelan) and Party Committee meetings are ongoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Development and Administration</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lumbini Provincial government has not submitted the budget even though three months have already been completed in the Fiscal Year (FY). The previous government led by CPN-UML, Shankar Pokharel had introduced this FY budget through ordinance but the budget could not be passed due to the disagreement from the opposition. Since the last three months, opposition (CPN-UML) continued obstruction in Lumbini demanding the resignation of the Member of Parliament (MP), who crossed the floor. Two MPs of CPN-UML had crossed the floor during Shankar Pokharel. While, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning, Lumbini had prepared to submit the budget on October 6 but it was not succeeded as obstruction of opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, PM Sher Bahadur Deuba has not been able to implement their Common Minimum Program (CMP). PM Deuba on August 8 unveiled the CMP for working in the country’s national interest, Corona control, implementing federalism, ensuring good governance, peace and process including prioritizing the economic policy and development. But the government has not implemented their agenda except for the Corona control. Although citizens are satisfied with the prevention and control of Corona, but other agendas have not been implemented and it became limited to paper only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After dissolution of the parliament two times within six months on December 19, 2020, and May 22, 2021 respectively, the political dissatisfaction reached its peak among the parties.

Oli government are now a minority. While on 13 September, the newly-formed CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US)-led by Madhav Kumar Nepal official withdraw its support to the K.P. Oli government. CPN-UML split into two, while the Madhav Kumar Nepal faction formed a new party on August 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per the provision in the Constitution, Article 188 (2), a CM must take a vote of confidence within one month when the ruling party split. As CM of Province 2, Lalbabu Raut also needs to take a vote of confidence as on September 18, Janata Samajbati Party (JSP) also split into two; the group of Mahantha Thakur registered a new party as Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (Loktantrik). Previously, JSP had a single ruling party in Province 2. Now there is a collation government with JSP, Nepali Congress, and Maoist Center. On September 29, CM Raut finalized the date for taking vote of confidence on October 6.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, except of Province 2, CPN-UML had an almost two-thirds majority and was ruling in the federal and four provinces – namely Province 1, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini Provinces including two collation governments in Karnali and Sudurpaschim Provinces. Now, due to internal political strife, two CMs of Gandaki and Lumbini have already lost their positions. And the remaining two CMs of Province 1 and Bagmati from CPN-UML are also likely to lose their positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Formation of the Periodic Plan Delayed</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The political disagreement of the center has also affected the provincial governments. While six provinces have already formulated their period plans one year ago, Sudurpaschim falls behind. The Provincial Policy and Planning Commission, Sudurpaschim has estimated to take another six months in completing the plan; the commission took three months in hiring staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has delayed the developmental process of the province and concerned local levels. Like all provinces, Sudurpaschim has also completed its four years under a stable government, with just one year remaining to complete its five-year tenure. It is deplorable to see that it may still take six more months to complete a periodic plan that was intended to cover its five years of tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lack of implementation in Federal Civil Service Bill</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The political strife at the center seems to have affected the country’s administration and service delivery. After a long obstruction, the Federal Civil Service Bill was passed on September 29, 2020; however, the implementation of it is yet to be seen. Due to its lack of operation, there has been an obstruction in the transfer and promotion of employees at the federal, provincial, and local level. The bill was not passed due to the continued obstruction of the parliament from the political parties. According to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration, more than a thousand application letters have been submitted for transfer, but has not been acted upon and affected to the staff adjustment in all level of governments. Such delayed implementation of the required act is hampering the pensions of employees, service facilities, departmental punishment, and acceptance of resignations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Effort on Capital Budget Expenditure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 22, the newly appointed Finance Minister Janardan Sharma announced to mobilize at least 10 percent of the capital budget, each month. According to the report published by the Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO), Sher Bahadur Deuba-led administration had spent only 0.6 percent of the total capital budget in the first two months of the current Fiscal Year (FY) 2021-22 due to the budget holiday in 2nd week of September. This is the first time the country faced a budget holiday after Nepal adopted the federal system while the recent government failed to receive parliament’s approval through a substitution bill within 60 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per rule, the recognition of the ordinance must be passed by each assembly (Federal Parliament Assembly or National Assembly). On September 23, the National Assembly endorsed the replacement appropriation bill and then the government spent Nrs. 24.35 billion within the last week of September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, minister Sharma is taking efforts for implementing the budget effectively. Recently, Minister Sharma organized a high-level discussion with the secretaries of the ministries on September 27, and directed to prepare a work-plan within a week for effectively implementing the capital budget. The work plan’s effectiveness is yet to be seen, however, all three tiers of government have been often criticized for lack of implementation despite excellent plans/policies on paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frequent political commotions coupled with actions of central government has led to disturbances in all levels of governments and its sectors – economic and development activities, administration, and federalism implementation. The center political turmoil from the last six months has still not settled, and Province 1 and Bagmati still face its ripple. Inefficiency and delays may cause citizens to again lose hope from the new government.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671104466_NG_Rupandehi-pradeshpramukh-1536x1082.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-09', '2021-10-27', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 23:26:06', '2022-12-15 23:26:06'),

In the said report, huge arrears including irregularities in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019/20 were found to be made by the three tiers of government – federal, provincial, local as well as ministries and its bodies. After the federal election, the OAG continuously presented three annual reports; 56th, 57th, and 58th respectively. In all Fiscal Years, average irregularities in the financial amount have been increasing year wise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reportedly, the arrears and irregularities of the government reached NPR 676.44 billion in the FY 2019/20 – an increase from the last FY’s amount of NPR 664.44. Similarly, the outstanding amount has reached to NPR 418.85 billion in the 58th report, which has been settled by the government. All levels of government spent a huge amount behind the law – such as purchases were made without proof and no billing system was maintained, which contributed to the irregularities, report showed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irregularities happened not only from the local representatives and political sphere but also due to the bureaucracy. As federalism is new, irregularities from the local representative could be a new challenge for the government. However, the bureaucrats have also been involved in the irregularities, while they have had a long experience of the government system. The ministries’ irregularities appear huge as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Arrears Increasing Every Year</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Report, arrears amount has increased by a large number than last year. Arrears and irregularities are surging every year at all local levels, ministries, and its bodies as showed in the report. For example, the local levels’ irregularities reached NPR 24 billion in the FY 2017/18, compared to NPR 38 billion in FY 2018/19, and now to NPR 41 billion according to the 58th OAG report in the FY 2019/20. Similarly, provincial levels’ irregularities reached NPR 190 million in FY 2018/19, while in the FY 2019/20, it reached NPR 820 million. Comparatively, the irregularities of the provincial level increased four times in FY 2019/20 compared to 2018/19. Likewise, in the federal government, arrear amount reached NPR 44.39 billion and in provincial and local government, it reached NPR 12.66 billion and NPR 40.83 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where are The Arrears</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 58th OAG report, out of 753 local governments, 147 local governments have expended NPR 76.8 million for the meeting allowance. However, as per the provision, only the members of the judicial, legislative, accounts, and Good Governance Committee are allowed to receive allowance. Similarly provincial government spent a huge budget on the vehicle purchase. Twenty-seven local governments received money from the federal government last year to build industrial villages, but in vain. Another example of arrears is 28 local governments illegally spending NPR 14.38 million for vehicle purchase. Similarly, 47 local bodies have spent NPR 19.07 million in purchase of clothes and attire. Similarly, the OAG report stated that 84 local bodies spent NPR 36.35 million for communication, monitoring, house rent, transportation and fuel expenses, indicating that these transactions made were either personal or way above the market price. Similarly, 131 local levels have illegally hired personal secretaries and advisers to pay them monthly NPR 92.91 million collectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Failed Submission of Audit</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of local governments not submitting audit reports has been increasing every year. According to the OAG, several local governments have not been able to submit and audit report. Reportedly, during the last three years, 6 local levels have not conducted an audit report to the OAG in the FY 2017/18. Similarly, 10 local levels failed in the FY 2018/19, however, 59 local levels failed in the FY 2019/20, the 58th audit report showed. Justifying their delay, several local governments blamed the COVID-19 crisis for not being able to submit to the OAG, their financial report. However, the government was not submitted an audit report in the previous year as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Two Aspects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is two aspects of the arrears and irregularities over the country. According to OAG, three tiers of government repeatedly ignored the rule provided by the OAG to submit their report, which led to the huge number of irregularities to appear. While another aspect is from the three tiers government, who claim that all the governments are in charge to expend their budget as per their rules. Normally in federal practice, all three tiers of government can spend by making their own rules. Thus, the contradictory laws of the Nepal government is the root cause of misunderstanding regarding arrears and audit report submission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 58th annual audit report presents that all levels of governments, ministries, and its bodies and committees have spent huge amount by crossing the limitation of rules. The arrears in the OAG pointed out that the public service provided by all the bodies is at serious concern. The provincial governments – the newest form of government – had the opportunity to set a new standard by maintaining good governance and transparency. However, the provincial level also drowned in the irregulars as the center and local government.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671104751_Pro_ktmpresidenti-1-1536x887.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-08', '2021-09-20', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 23:30:51', '2022-12-15 23:30:51'),

Despite opposition’s criticism in the budget performance as provincial governments passed the budget without discussion and consent. Interestingly, the ruling parties’ leaders also criticized the budget. The leaders were demanding to amend the budget titles, but the ruling party ignored the opposition’s voice and finalized the budget. This type of budgeting process does not address inclusive development, and is likely going to be misused.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Asadhe Bikas</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Asadhe Bikas (when a budget is spent at a large portion at end of the Fiscal Year) was again prioritized in the last FY 2020/21. Reportedly, the government spent a huge budget (37%) in the last month of the Fiscal Year, i.e. Asadh of the Nepali calendar, however, the government spent only 27% of the budget in the first 11 months. This is not new; the government has been giving priority to Asadhe Bikas since long. Asade Bikas is not new in the history of Nepali economy, however, astounding is that, after six years post the commencement of the Constitution of Nepal 2015 and three and a half years since the instigation of the new local government, the tendency of Asadhe Bikas has not died. Corruption is more likely to dominate such a budget expenditure, which directly impacts project implementation and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Delay Cabinet Expansion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>More than one month after assuming office, Chief Minister (CM) Lalbabu Raut in Province 2 and CM Krishan Chandra Nepali Pokharel in Gandaki Pradesh, respectively, were able to give full shape to their cabinets on July 23 and July 15. But due to the mismatch of power-sharing in both provinces, Janta Samajwadi Party (JSP) in Gandaki Pradesh and Maoist Center (MC) in Province 2 have been dissatisfied with CMs as they ignored the opposition’s demand in the government. Similarly, after more than two weeks of assuming office, Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba in the federal government is yet to give full shape to his cabinet. Due to the lack of consent among the political parties for power-sharing in the cabinet, has led to the cabinet not being formed yet. This type of administration system again questions political instability.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Abolition of Federalism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The federalism implementation-related issues have emerged now after Bibeksheel Nepal Party President Rabindra Mishra proposed abolishing federalism. This is the personal view on federalism, Mishra said. Mishra argued that Nepal’s federalism is costly and it is a danger to territorial integrity. Mishra is being widely criticized for this proposal. This proposal indirectly supports the monarchy in his imagination in the country which many view to be wrong for Nepal. Experts said politician Mishra wants political space through his unique arguments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Political domination has been spaced in every sector. The leaders are prioritizing the power-sharing game targeting the coming election. As a result, all levels of government administration are being suffered. The country has not been able to move in the right direction due to poor budget performance, power-sharing games, and political strife.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671105488_RoS-KTM-PMDeubac-scaled-1-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-07', '2021-08-17', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 23:43:08', '2022-12-15 23:43:08'),

Where the Federal government presented their budget of Rs 1.647 trillion and the provincial government, Rs 261 billion. Several local governments have been unable to present their budget for the next fiscal year in time</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Criticism in the Provincial Budget</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>National budgets usually bring forth criticisms, which helps improve the budget implementation for the future. However, this year provincial government have crossed all the line and rendered budget useless. For example, Province 1 has allocated Rs 10 million to make Statesman’s Park, similarly, Province 2 has allocated 60 million to make statues and 10 million for a memorial park, while Bagmati Pradesh has allocated several budgets targeted to develop Ayodhayapuri in Chitwan. Similarly, Sudurpaschim Pradesh has also allocated Rs 190 million for the painting of the provincial assembly building. However, in a dire condition brought forth by COVID-19, creating jobs, relief packages and other prior sectors seem to be ignored in the budgetary planning of the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The budget that the provincial assemblies finalized was highly criticized even by the ruling party. This gives an isolated meaning, since normally, party demonstration support to any type policies and programs as long as the planners are within the party.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Criticism of local budget</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Several local governments have been unable to present the budget in a timely manner. According to the National Association of Rural Municipality’s data, 70 local governments are unable to present their budget while the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration shows that 458 local governments including Lalitpur Metropolitan City have been unable to present the budget in time. This indicates that the local governments are not serious regarding their responsibilities in budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, budget preparation, infrastructure development and other local services are interrelated. Thus, when budget is delivered in time, development and local services can get accelerated. Local governments are also deprived of federal and provincial governments’ grants if they fail to present their income and expenditure in time. Which in turn affects all sectors of development, administration, services, and others within the local government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the three tiers of government’s budget presentation signals that the lawmakers have drafted the budget in their interest – neither of the people nor proportional development. Such a budget allocation process is in favor of the constituency area of a certain group of leaders, which is harmful to the development and federalism. Nonetheless, MPs in the Province 2 are still demanding to hike the amount of the Parliamentary Development Fund. Such a fund opens path for the leader’s interest and further criticism.</p>', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671360119_default-img.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-06', '2021-07-13', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-15 23:48:51', '2022-12-18 22:26:59'),

There is no sign of stability as coalition government has been trapped in the distribution of power-sharing. It is inevitable that the cabinet formation under his leadership will be delayed as it was in his predecessor, Mahendra Bahadur Shahi’s leadership. So far, CM Jeevan Bahadur Shahi has only appointed least Ministers for his cabinet portfolio. On November 1, Chief Minister of Karnali, Mahendra Bahadur Shahi resigned from his post to be succeeded by Nepali Congress leader, Jeevan Bahadur Shahi as per the gentleman’s agreement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlmost all the CMs of the provincial governments have reshuffled their cabinet portfolios several times. The governments in Provinces 1 and Bagmati is suffering a blow to their provincial functioning due to a delay in cabinet expansion. CM Rai of Province 1 is preparing to split three ministries for the distribution of power-sharing. Earlier, CM Prithvi Subba Gurung in Gandaki Province had also split the ministries to balance the power-sharing. Such repeated reshuffle in the provincial cabinet has continued to hamper the smooth functioning of provincial and local government, whilst also increasing the financial expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Effect in the budget implementation</span></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Finance Comptroller General Office (FCGO), the government has spent the capital budget of 4.5% only during the first quarter. While the government had announced to implement at least 10% by the first three months, and 10% each month following, of the capital budget at any cost. But, the ruling government is spending poorer capital budget than the previous government. While the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration has been able to spend less than 5% of the capital budget during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot only the federal government, but the provincial government has also poor capital budget implementation. For example, Karnali Province has spent 4.83% of the capital budget in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. While other provinces have the same status in the budget implementation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, the minister for the Economic Affairs and Planning of Province 1, Indra Bahadur Angboo is preparing to revise the previous budget through the Replacement Bill at the time of implementation. While, Gandaki, and Lumbini Province has already revised their budget when the government changed. The practice might change the practice of manipulating the budget for their leader interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe activities of the federal and provincial government in turn affects the citizens. At present, the people are awaiting the election with a hope of a stability in the country’s political scenario. However, with the past and present track record of the leaders and parties, can the citizens hope for a better scenario?</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671166993_DRS-sindhupalchok-2.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-12-14', NULL, '0', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 16:48:13', '2022-12-16 19:12:54'),

According to the Home Ministry’s assessment, there are several issues along the Sino-Nepal Border in Humla. According to the report, state policy should address border challenges. The report suggests that the Chinese attempted to construct a 145 meters permanent canal within Nepali territory. Chinese has also fenced and wired pillars 6(1) and 10. Nepali nationals are likewise barred from using regions between pillars 5(2) and 4.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn October 4, the Ministry of Home Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) requesting that Nepal-China border disputes in Humla be handled amicably through diplomatic initiatives. According to the Nepal-China boundary protocol, joint border inspections must be undertaken every ten years. The most recent joint border examination took place in 2006. As per Joint-secretary Jay Narayan Acharya establishing encroachment involves a collaborative study and careful investigation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, China always has denied any border encroachment on Nepal’s northern border. The Chinese Embassy’s spokesperson stated that the report does not corroborate the Nepal-China boundary dispute. This year marks the 60th anniversary of Nepal and China’s boundary treaty. The border has been free from any dispute since its inception. The continual denial of China in recognizing boundary disputes in Nepal’s northern border may create difficulties in resolving the issue. This may cause strain the relations between the two countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, the strategic partnership between China and Nepal has barely progressed in the last two years. The analysts say that the term ‘strategic partnership’ is ambiguous. Even the Trade and Transit agreement signed in 2019 is unimplemented as the standard operating procedure is not formulated yet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, Nepal and China are still putting efforts to maintain the relationship between the two. In a telephone conversation Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed his full support to Nepal. He stated that he wanted to truly protect multilateralism, resist interference in the country’s internal affairs, counteract unilateralism, and cooperate with Nepal on the issues of common interest between the two countries and regions. Minister Wang also declared that Nepal would get further vaccine assistance in the battle against the battle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina is providing 1 million doses of the Sino Vac Covid-19 vaccine as a grant to Nepal. China is also giving 5 million RNB worth of medical aid to improve our health system and prepare for the third pandemic wave. Additionally, Nepal Army is receiving 300,000 doses of vaccine from China as a grant. 1.6 million doses of the Vero Cell vaccine reached Kathmandu on October 20, 22, and 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal appears to be warming up relations with India recently, especially party to party relations. India also has welcomed such efforts of Nepal; since Bhutan and China signed an MOU of accelerating negotiations on their border dispute, it has become imperative for India to maintain a good relationship with all its neighbors. Nepali Congress had invited Vijay Chauthiawale (BJP’s Foreign Affairs Department head) and Ram Madhav (BJP national general secretary) to Nepal last month. As a reciprocal gesture, Vijay Chauthaiwale also invited a few Nepali congress leaders. A three-member delegation led by Prakash Saran Mahat (joint party secretary), including Udaya Shumsher Rana and Ajaya Chaurasia, visited New Delhi on October 7. They met BJP’s President JP Nadda, National General Secretary Arun Singh, Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishakar, and Vijay Chauthaiwale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe delegation in the meeting with Jaishankar on October 8 discussed the “Tuin Incident” of Darchula. Minister Jaishankar gave an affirmative response and stated that an investigation would be carried out. The meeting also focused on border disputes, supply of manure, import of Covid-19 vaccine, and many other issues. The delegation’s visit is significant. BJP has not engaged in Party-level talks with Nepal’s major political parties in a long time. The Nepali congress also had a gap in building relations-building endeavors. Further, both the parties hold are fundamentally similar ideologies, and that could make such engagements easier. The Nepali Congress has been attempting to strengthen ties with the ruling party of India since 2014. The delegation also met Uttar Pradesh’s Chief Minister, Adityanath Yogi, who has deep ties with numerous Hindu temple organizations and Hindu rights parties. Apart from deliberating on the security issues, Chief Minister Yogi stressed the importance of Nepal conserving and preserving its culture and religion. He also stated that both countries’ governments should prioritize building relations between their people, who share the same religion and culture. He said that helping Nepal and resolving its problem should be a top priority for India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and India are striving to bolster bilateral relations on various fronts. On October 22, India handed over the railway to Nepal and signed an operating procedure for the railway’s operations in October. However, the railway has not been operational due to a lack of relevant laws and personnel resources. India’s Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. would also give 25 employees to run the rail for a year. After that, Nepali staff will take over the running of the service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, A delegation led by Tirtha Raj Wagle (Chief and Joint Secretary of Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ South Asia Division), experts from the Ministry of Defense, and the Nepal Army is attending a military security meeting with India in Bangalore on November 27.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, there are still issues that need to be addressed through a diplomatic process. A team led by Dev Karan Kalwar and Bikram Khanal, shedding light on the border dispute in the Susta area, submitted a memorandum to Home Minister Balkrishna Khand demanding demarcation of the Nepal-India border area by installing fenced pillars. Additionally, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) requested the MoFA to take diplomatic steps with India to conduct a population census in Kalapani, Limpiyadhura, and Lipulekh. The MoFA has not confirmed the status of the request of the CBS regarding the same.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671167651_BB_BAITADI_KHOP.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-10', '2021-11-16', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 16:59:11', '2022-12-16 16:59:11');

Contrary to its positive developments, the month also recorded some major downfalls which including a meager record in export earnings from high-value goods as listed by the National Trade Integrated System (NTIS), an exorbitant price hike of gasoline fuel and aviation fuel by the Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC), a possible liquidity crunch in the money and financial markets and a fall in remittance earnings as sent by domestic migrant labourers, abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Timeline of Major Events in November</h2>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Date</th>\r\n			<th scope=\"row\">Event</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>03 November</td>\r\n			<td>Export earnings from listed or high value products increased by a meager 2 percent year-on-year during the first quarter of the current fiscal year (FY) 2021/22.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>09 November</td>\r\n			<td>Department of Electricity Development approved 16 new solar projects with a total capacity of 93 megawatts for the current fiscal (FY) 2021/22.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>10 November</td>\r\n			<td>Nepal Oil Corporation hiked prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene, cooking gas cylinder and aviation fuel in its new revised list for November.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>14 November</td>\r\n			<td>According to the Annual Report on Public Debt 2020-21, Nepal’s domestic debt reached Nrs. 802.94 billion (USD 6.74 billion) in the last fiscal year (FY) 2020/21.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>16 November</td>\r\n			<td>Remittance earnings decreased by 7.6 percent, from Nrs. 258.91 billion (USD 2.17 billion) to Nrs. 239.32 billion (USD 2.01 billion) during the first three months of the current fiscal year (FY) 2021/22.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>16 November</td>\r\n			<td>Export earnings from Nepali coffee soared by 66.37 percent in the last fiscal year (FY) 2020/21 as per the Nepal Tea and Coffee Development Board.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>20 November</td>\r\n			<td>Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) launched the highly anticipated National Payment Switch (NPS).</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>22 November</td>\r\n			<td>Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA) revealed that 12.86 million people are using the 4G internet services across the country.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h2>National Payment Switch (NPS) Launched to Positive Acclaim</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) launched the much-anticipated National Payment Switch (NPS) on 18 November 2021, alongside handing over its operational responsibility to Nepal Clearing House (NCH). The payment switch in its first phase has brought together 29 banks and financial institutions (BFIs) within which 18 are commercial banks, 5 are development banks and 6 are finance companies. Similarly, NPS has bought together services including Nepal-Pay QR, Network QR, Direct Debit Request-To-Pay, E-Mandate, interconnection between wallets and inter-connection through biller gateway for different payments. Moreover, NPS has also allowed banks, financial institutions and non-banking financial institutions to share information with one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implementation of NPS has been regarded as a significant step towards the development of a secure, safe and efficient payment system. While Nepal’s digital payment system is still in its nascent stage, the country has recorded some commendable online transaction figures; particularly since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. As per NRB’s latest figures, Nepal’s electronic payment soared to Nrs. 753.30 billion (USD 6.32 billion) during the first two months of the current fiscal year (FY) 2021/22 as compared to Nrs. 378.85 billion (USD 3.18 billion) in the last fiscal year (FY) 2020/21. Considering this, NPS comes as a huge respite to the general public who previously could not perform inter-wallet transactions alongside make digital transactions without depending on Visa or Mastercard. Moreover, with the on-going pandemic, digital and contactless payments have become more vital in speeding up seamless payment network and service providers; and NPS as a centralized national payment system can significantly accelerate the central bank’s ambition in achieving the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Liquidity Crunch on Steady Rise</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Liquidity crunch has been on a steady rise in Nepal’s economy. While the impact of increasing imports, declining remittance earnings, high demand for domestic loans and delay by the government in raising internal loans has added towards the crunch; in particularly, the limited availability of loanable funds and low capital expenditure has been accelerating the on-going crisis. As per the recent data released by the central bank (NRB), deposits at banks and financial institutions (BFIs) increased by only 0.7 percent or Nrs. 4.7 trillion (USD 35.48 billion), whereas credit distribution increased by 5.7 percent in the current fiscal. The cash shortage has also left financial systems with only Nrs. 55 billion (USD 459 million) in disposal. Similarly, weak capital spending/expenditure too has been contributing towards the liquid volatility. Capital expenditure of the federal government as of mid-November stood at a meager 4.53 percent of the total allocation of Nrs. 440 billion (USD 3.67 billion) for the current fiscal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While liquidity crunch is not a new phenomenon in Nepal, the current one seems to have bigger consequences. With Covid-19 restrictions slowly lifting up and businesses finally restarting, the government should have prioritized injection of credit in the financial system alongside speeding up collection of internal loans. The current cash crunch clearly demonstrates the institutional inefficiency of both the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) in ensuring smooth cash flow in the money market. Considering this, both the entities must address the failures in monetary management and regulatory oversight of the financial system before businesses, enterprises and BFIs head towards a greater cash crisis or even bankruptcy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gasoline and Aviation Fuel Getting Dearer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The state-owned Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) in the second week of November introduced a new revised list, hiking the price of petroleum products. According to the latest hike, price of petrol, diesel, kerosene has increased by Nrs. 3 each (USD 0.025), while the price of cooking gas has increased by Nrs. 75 (USD 0.63) to reach Nrs. 136 (USD 1.14) per litre, Nrs 119 (USD 1.0) per litre, Nrs. 119 (USD 1.0) per litre and Nrs. 1575 (USD 13.23) per cylinder, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal is highly dependent on India for most of its fuel imports and has been importing from its Southern neighbour since 1974. According to the import statistics for fiscal year (FY) 2020/21, the country imported gasoline fuel worth Nrs. 164 billion (USD 1.37 billion) per month from India. While NOC does buy cheap fuels from India, it pays higher taxes to the government under various headings for every purchase from IOC. As of the latest figure, it paid value added tax (VAT) of Nrs. 55.23 (USD 0.46) per litre on petrol and Nrs. 37.90 (USD 0.32) per litre as revenue and VAT on diesel. This has pushed NOC in determining higher prices by adding charges under various headings including infrastructure tax and pollution charges; ultimately making gasoline fuels dearer and exorbitant for customers who purchase it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Questionable Performance from NTIS Listed Products</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Export earnings from listed or high value products recorded a meager 2 percent increase year-on-year during the first quarter of the current fiscal year (FY) 2021/22. According to the statistics revealed by the Trade and Export Promotion Council (TEPC), shipments made by Nepal during the three months period between mid-July to mid-October 2021 was worth Nrs. 10.30 billion (USD 86 million), compared to a figure of Nrs. 10 billion (USD 84 million) during the first quarter of the last fiscal (FY) 2020/21. Within the shipments, export of yarns, carpet, pashmina, medicinal herbs, textile, footwear and leather increased by a few margins whereas shipments of cardamom and tea dropped drastically by 12.8 percent and 53 percent, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trade experts and businessmen have cited the lack in coordination between government agencies and in particular the failure on part of Nepal Trade Integrated System (NTIS) for the recent fall in export of high value products. Even after a decade of its establishment, NTIS goods are yet to find a competitive margin in the international market. Similarly, the efficiency of policies regarding promotion of the listed products is also yet to be observed. Moreover, high freight charges, supply-chain constraints, low investment in trade infrastructure and trade facilitations and high cost of production too have impacted the export basket and export earnings from NTIS products; eventually obstructing Nepal’s aim of reducing its trade deficit via export earnings.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671168009_RS_KTM_D3A2607-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-11', '2021-12-14', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 17:05:09', '2022-12-16 17:05:09'),

A support of the five-party alliances to Deuba was appointed as the PM on July 13. There were only six members in the cabinet including PM, before a full-shape was given. Now it has reached 25, including 22 ministers and three ministers of state in the Deuba cabinet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNonetheless, this is the first time in the history of Nepali politics, the PM has not been able to expand the cabinet for such a long period. The delay in cabinet expansion has had several impacts on the day-to-day functioning of the administration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was not only the central government that took a long time in the cabinet expansion, Chief Minister of Lumbini Province, Kul Prasad KC’s administration took two months in the cabinet expansion. CM KC on October 10 formed a 17-member cabinet. However, he was appointed as CM on August 12. During the formation of cabinet, CM KC added seven new ministers and three state ministers.The power-sharing of central government affected the provincial government which in turn delayed the cabinet expansion both in the central and provincial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">The vote of confidence in the provincial government</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Minister of Province 2 Lalbabu Raut on October 6 won the vote of confidence in the Provincial Assembly.

Out of 104-members in the Provincial Assembly, CM Raut received 77 votes whilst as many as 23 votes against him, and four lawmakers remained absent. CM Raut got support from the JSP-N, Nepali Congress, and CPN-Unified Socialist.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, Province 1 and Bagmati Province also required a vote of confidence as per the constitution provision following the split of the ruling party. CPN-UML Vice-chair Asta Laxmi Shakya in Bagmati and Bhim Acharya in Province 1 were appointed as CMs on August 18 and 26 respectively. Both CMs have been suffering into the minority when the ruling party split into two parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On October 27, Bagmati CM Shakya submitted her resignation to Provincial Chief Yadav Chandra Sharma. CM Shakya confirmed that she did not win the vote of confidence from the Provincial Assembly and she decided to resign. Meanwhile, the parliamentary party leader of the CPN-US, Rajendra Pandey was appointed on October 28 as CM of Bagmati Province. Recently, the new CM Pandey formed a four-member cabinet. And as per the constitutional provision, CM Pandey also needs to seek the vote of confidence within 1 month of his appointment. As coalition government, CM Pandey has a good chance of winning the vote of confidence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, despite being a minority, Province 1 Chief Minister Bhim Acharya on October 24 was ready to take the vote of confidence in the Provincial Assembly. The Provincial Assembly secretariat adjourned the Provincial Assembly meeting for October 31 after the main opposition Nepali Congress demanded to postpone after signaling to cross the floor. While the ruling CPN-UML had also requested the Speaker to postpone the meeting till October 30 as the party’s Local Convection (Palika Sammelan) and Party Committee meetings are ongoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Development and Administration</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lumbini Provincial government has not submitted the budget even though three months have already been completed in the Fiscal Year (FY). The previous government led by CPN-UML, Shankar Pokharel had introduced this FY budget through ordinance but the budget could not be passed due to the disagreement from the opposition. Since the last three months, opposition (CPN-UML) continued obstruction in Lumbini demanding the resignation of the Member of Parliament (MP), who crossed the floor. Two MPs of CPN-UML had crossed the floor during Shankar Pokharel. While, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning, Lumbini had prepared to submit the budget on October 6 but it was not succeeded as obstruction of opposition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, PM Sher Bahadur Deuba has not been able to implement their Common Minimum Program (CMP). PM Deuba on August 8 unveiled the CMP for working in the country’s national interest, Corona control, implementing federalism, ensuring good governance, peace and process including prioritizing the economic policy and development. But the government has not implemented their agenda except for the Corona control.

While there is an increment in domestic and international consumption of the region’s goods and services, economic growth is still weak and fragile for most parts. As most economies are operating below pre-pandemic growth averages, they have been left vulnerable, more so due to the uneven vaccination drive, fear of a possible third wave/new virus outbreak and possible economic shutdowns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the new projection expects the South Asian region to grow by 7.1 percent during 2021, with major growth ushered in by digitization and service-led development. For Nepal, the new growth model definitely seems encouraging. The country had recently adopted the ‘Kathmandu Declaration’ as a joint commitment of the government and development partners towards the country’s Green Resilient and Inclusive Development (GRID). Moreover, with new advancements in production and technology, the country has been making a gradual shift from its traditional manufacturing sector to a more modern industrial sector; capitalizing on profits and gains along the way. Similarly, acceleration of digital services, in particular the use of digital payment/transactions in sectors including bank and investment, transportation, recreation, communication, education and so on is also anticipated to further the growth drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, while the growth projection looks small, it’s focus looks promising, particularly for Nepal. With over 21.43 percent of the total population fully vaccinated, industrial income increasing by a hopeful 8 percent, and travel and tourism businesses opening up, the year-on-year growth appears strong provided the country can mobilize the private sector, utilize on digital services, identify goods of comparative advantage and reform policies and regulations with regards to business and investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Late monsoon destroys agricultural crops</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Post-monsoon rains across Nepal destroyed agricultural crops worth billions of rupees during the third week of October. According to statistics and reports from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MoALD), the recent landslides and floods has induced damage to paddy worth Nrs. 8.26 billion (USD 68.80 million) across provinces including Sudurpashchim, Lumbini and Province 1. In terms of districts, Bardiya, Kapilvastu, Banke, Rupandehi, Kailali, Kanchanpur, Jhapa, Sunsari, Morang and so on have been badly affected. A total of 85,580 hectares of ready-to-harvest land has been swept away or submerged by floodwaters. In terms of tonnes, around 325,258 tonnes has been destroyed. The loss inflicted upon livestock and food stored by farmers remains unaccounted/uncounted for. While President Bidya Devi Bhandari has summoned officials at the agriculture ministry to take account of the situation and prepare for relief distribution and measures, the victims are least hopeful of getting compensated or relieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being an agrarian country where agriculture contributes around 36 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) and employs around 66 percent of the total population, the unusual rainfall very accurately has shown the fault lines in the government’s policies and practices with regards to the sector. Even with warnings and cautions from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), concerned authorities seemed lax in their approach and preparation regarding the weather change and the heavy rainfall. Moreover, with the Covid-19 pandemic and its repercussions already adding to the woes of farmers, the current situation has further exposed their risks, with little hopes of bouncing back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering this, the government this time must focus on concentrated efforts rather than simply allocating token relief materials. For instance, ensuring relief coverage to all farmers specially at rural and highly effected areas and establishment of storage and transportation facilities as immediate relief measures in the short-run and better access to seeds, fertilizers and other plant nutrients, provision of soft loan facility to farmers, access to irrigation and promotion of modern and commercial agricultural tools as intermediate relief measures in the long-run could help the disaster-stricken farmers and sector in gaining back their foothold.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Favorable environment for FDI inflows</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Department of Industry (DoI) reported that the country received investment pledges of Nrs. 146 billion (USD 1.21 billion) during the first quarter of the current fiscal year (FY) 2021/22. A total of 194 companies, 107 foreign companies and 87 domestic companies have pledged amounts worth Nrs. 24 billion (USD 199 million) and Nrs. 122 billion (USD 1.01 billion), respectively. Similarly, foreign companies have also pledged to provide job and employment opportunities to 7,195 individuals across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a stable and favorable environment for investment has been credited for these investment pledges, collaboration between the Investment Board of Nepal (IBN) and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) has also played a major role in attracting investment (both foreign and domestic) into the country. Both the government and the private sector were vying to fulfill the country’s investment requirements and ambitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal is in need of diversified investment across various economic sectors to transform the country’s economy from a traditional model to a more modern one. Moreover, coordination and communication between the government and private entities was also long overdue. Nevertheless, the gap between the FDI pledged and realization needs proper addressing. Lengthy and cumbersome legal procedures might result in investments not reaching targeted economic sectors. Thus, both IBN and FNCCI need stronger lobbying to bring in changes in this matter; only then would their collaborative effort result in fruitful outcomes.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671168465_DL_FUNGLING_DHALEKODHAN-1536x1152.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-10', '2021-11-16', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 17:12:45', '2022-12-16 17:12:45'),

The position of foreign minister remained vacant for two months; in the meantime, Deuba was heading the foreign ministry. After a long wait, President Bidhya Devi Bhandari appointed senior Nepali Congress leader Dr. Narayan Khadka as Nepal’s Minister of Foreign Affairs on the government’s recommendation on September 22.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinister Khadka, in a press conference, stated that he would endeavor to maintain highly warm, friendly, amiable, and balanced relations with both China and India. He further stated that the country’s foreign policy is not unique to any one political party, and he will seek to build national consensus amongst all the parties on issues relating to foreign relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal Participates in UN General Assembly</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Newly appointed foreign minister Khadka represented Nepal in the 76th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session in New York. While addressing the UNGA, he underlined a few things, such as Nepal’s commitment to overcoming climate change, graduating from the LDC category by 2026. He also shared that Nepal denounces all forms of terrorism, and he stressed the importance of safeguarding human rights. He further enunciated that Nepal’s foreign policy is premised on the principles of the UN Charter, non-alignment, international law, and norms of world peace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, Minister Khadka acknowledged that MCC could not be amended at this stage on the UNGA sideline event in New York. He stated that national consensus on the agreement is essential; however, spreading erroneous information was wrong. He also said MCC is in the country’s interest, and declining MCC would question Nepal’s credibility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBesides, Minister Khadka also held a bilateral meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart on September 26. During the meeting, the two discussed the necessity to improve cooperation in trade, investment, hydropower, and cross-border energy trade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinister Khadka appears to have adopted “Amity with all enmity with none”; nonetheless, balancing China’s interest while embracing MCC will be an onerous task.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Indo-Nepal Relations</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A 33-year-old Nepali national returning home to Darchula via improvised cable crossing locally known as Tuin went missing on July 30 after India’s Sashastra Seema Bal allegedly detached the Tuin. Nepal refrained from giving any strong reaction regarding the incident. Rather Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) admonished everyone to apply caution while reporting the incident as it is a geopolitically sensitive issue. Nevertheless, there were protests, and a dummy of the Indian Prime Minister burnt. Nepal government formed a probe committee to investigate the incident. However, Nepal received no cooperation from the Indian side even after seeking the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s government probed the case and submitted the report to the MoHA on September 2. The government has not disclosed the details yet. The ministry released a statement stating that the report recommended taking diplomatic initiatives with India. The government initially was reluctant to take a position even after the report was submitted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, On September 3, the Nepal government finally sent a diplomatic note to India after receiving much flak from the coalition partners. The note urged the Indian government to probe the matter and compensate the family for the loss. On receiving the diplomatic note, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson stated that they were unaware of the incident. Also, no official communication regarding the same was corresponded. India has not formally responded to the diplomatic note, displaying its nonchalance in handling the situation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis incident yet again highlighted the outlook of India towards Nepal. While this incident received extensive coverage in Nepali media, Indian media have shown callousness in reporting the same, providing insight into how India perceives Nepal. India seems to have developed a tendency to evade any issue that puts India in an uncomfortable position. For example, the Kalapani dispute is left unresolved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia is actively engaging with Nepal in the trade and economic domain. There are multiple instances, such as Managing Director of Nepal Electricity Authority Kulman Ghising signed an MOU with India’s state-run Power Grid Corporation on September 8 to build a transnational 400kV transmission line from Butwal to Gorakhpur. The agreement was signed to augment the two-way electricity trade. Similarly, Nepal and India are to sign a five-year agreement for periodic monitoring and inspections of airport and radar flights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, Minister Khadka met his Indian Counterpart Dr. S Jaishankar in New York. Jaishankar stated that he looked forward to strengthening his special relationship with Nepal. Anurag Srivastava, joint Secretary North at India’s MEA, reached Kathmandu on September 28. He will be meeting Nepal’s Finance Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Acting Foreign secretary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and India seem to enjoy smooth operations regarding most activities except when it comes to addressing Nepal’s concerns raised over a matter, in which case it attempts to brush aside pressing concerns raised by Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal-China Relations</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue of China encroaching on Nepal’s territory came to the fore last year when Congress was in opposition. After the senior congress leaders raised concern over excluding the Humla border issue from the Common Minimum Program, the issue again came to light. On September 1, Deuba announced the formation of a task force to study the border dispute in Humla. The MoHA formed a team encompassing representatives from Nepal Police, Armed Police Force, and the Survey Department, led by Jaya Narayan Acharya, a joint secretary at the Home Ministry, to study border issues with China. The task force submitted the report to MoHA on September 26. The task force found that certain boundary pillars were rebuilt and fenced without Nepal’s consent. The report recommends that the government take necessary action to inspect the area diplomatically and jointly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, convincing China to agree to inspect the disputed area will be difficult bilaterally. China maintains its stance firmly that there is no border dispute between China and Nepal, to which earlier Nepal concurred hastily despite the lack of formal proof. Nepal’s previous assertion concerning the border has already weakened Nepal’s position regarding its new claim.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671168752_DR-Narayan-Khadka-2.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-09', '2021-10-29', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 17:17:32', '2022-12-16 17:17:32'),

As per the report, merchandise exports increased by 115.9 percent to reach Nrs. 20.76 billion (USD 175 million) as compared to an increase of 8.9 percent during the same period of the last fiscal. Yet the increasing exports fell short in terms of increasing imports. According to NRB, merchandise imports increased by 75.7 percent to register an import bill worth Nrs. 150.73 billion (USD 1.27 billion) as compared to a decrease of 19.6 percent during the last fiscal; expanding the export-import ratio to 13.8 percent from the previous 11.2 percent. Similarly, remittance inflows reduced by 18.1 percent to reach Nrs. 75.96 billion (USD 643 million) in a steep contrast to an increase of 23 percent in the previous fiscal. With most of the remittance earnings being channeled into imports, foreign currency reserves too dropped by 3.2 percent to Nrs. 1,353.82 billion (USD 11.46 billion) during the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this definitely is an alarming situation in the nation’s external economy, it is not the first time that such figures have been revealed by the central bank. Nepal (being an import dependent nation) has been buying more (imports) goods and services than what it sells (exports). With nominal earning from exports, the country’s trade imbalance has been on an upward growing trend for the last five years. The ‘Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation’ published by the central bank in fiscal year (FY) 2014/15 recorded imports at Nrs. 774.68 billion (USD 6.56 billion). By fiscal year (FY) 2018/19, imports registered a staggering amount of Nrs. 1418.53 billion (USD 12 billion) within the nation’s current account; with a year-on-year growth of 13 percent annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a number of factors including small export basket, high production cost, non-tariff barriers and weak trade logistics can be reasoned out for the widening trade deficit; the country’s over-dependency on India for most of its imports has been identified as the major reason for the recent surge. Nepal’s trade deficit with India increased by 32 percent between fiscal year (FY) 2019/20 and (FY) 2020/21; reducing the country’s national savings (to meet the bloating imports) and impeding any scope of investment to help boost competitiveness of export-oriented products. Considering this, the nation needs to adopt stronger import-substitution policies including rejection of direct and indirect subsidies extended by its neighbors followed by local production of industrialized products and enhancing competitiveness of export-oriented products to reduce its trade deficit with India in the short run and trade deficit with rest of the world in the longer run.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tourism sector- A path towards revival</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The economy saw a mixed performance of its tourism sector this month. While requests from trade entrepreneurs regarding provision of on-arrival visa to fully vaccinated tourist and waiving quarantine requirements for such visitors was met, the sector is yet to embark upon a recovery path. The total number of international arrivals in Nepal for the month of August was dismal, registering at just 66,966 individuals. Similarly, a recent forecast by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) revised Nepal’s economic growth for fiscal year (FY) 2021/22 to 4.1 percent from the earlier 5.1 percent, largely due to the stationary and sluggish growth of the tourism sector. Moreover, with barely 20 percent of its population fully vaccinated, the country’s prospects of becoming a ‘vaccine vacation’ country too seems a distant dream. All these has casted uncertainty over the revival of the sector which prior to the Covid-19 pandemic contributed 6 percent to 7 percent to the national gross domestic product (GDP) and 2 percent to 3 percent towards employment growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this juncture, the country needs to come up with both- short-term and long-term recovery plans and policies if it aims to attract more tourists in the days to come. With Gandaki Province inviting ambassadors of 20 different countries to celebrate ‘World Tourism Day’, other provinces too can initiate similar revival strategies to invite both foreign and domestic tourists. To do so, local and provincial governments must prioritize caution and safety first alongside ensuring Covid-19 vaccinations to all those employed in the sector. Similarly, the federal government should advocate for Nepal’s removal from the ‘red zone list’ of the international travel advisory, considering its low Covid-19 infection rate and high recovery rate. Likewise, the government must implement the concessional schemes that it brought in the recent ‘replacement bill on budget ordinance’ to restore the tourism sector including necessary infrastructure construction, promotional programs, special discount for airlines companies on income tax and so on.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671168817_RadhikaKandel_Pokhara_RSS-261-1536x1152.jpeg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-09', '2021-10-29', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 17:18:37', '2022-12-16 17:18:37');

Delayed time and again due to the change in government and other bureaucratic reasons, the policy was disclosed months after the unveiling of the national budget, disrupting the implementation of financial provisions as laid in the national budget. Nevertheless, the policy has prioritized on providing respite to COVID-19 affected businesses by easing their access to the country’s financial and economic resources. The major focus of the policy for the new fiscal has been refinancing, rescheduling and restructuring of loans and maintenance of liquidity on targeted credit programs for tourism businesses, communications, transportation, SMEs, party palaces, gyms, cinema halls and so on. The policy has also included interest rate corridor for liquidity management, which has been maintained at 2 percent to 5 percent. Similarly, technical tools including statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) has been fixed at 10 percent, credit to core-capital plus deposit ratio (CCD) has been scrapped and replaced with the loan-to-deposit ratio, cash reserve ratio (CRR) has been maintained at 3 percent, bank rate at 5 percent and credit-deposit ratio (CDR) has increased from the previous 85 percent to 90 percent. Likewise, the policy has also encouraged mergers and acquisitions of banks and financial institutions (BFIs) by annulling the cooling-off period of six months for board members and executives from joining other institutions and by extending 1 percent leniency in the interest spread rate among many other provisions. Moreover, the central bank has also extended the deadline for paying loan installments by six months, nine months and one year, depending on the degree of impact of COVID-19 on the economic and productive sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these provisions, lack of proper communication and coordination between NRB and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) is anticipated to hamper the implementation of the new merits/provisions as laid in the monetary policy. With the Deuba government yet to table a new replacement bill for the ordinance budget (brought in by the previous Oli government), the new provisions and merits as laid in the monetary policy is expected to drastically change on the introduction of a new budget bill by the new government. In this context, the assumptions laid in the monetary policy seem factitious and demand a more realistic evaluation and consideration before its actual implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fall in foreign employment/earnings shrinks BoP surplus</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest ‘Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation of Nepal’ report published by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) revealed that Nepal’s balance of payments (BoP) registered a surplus of only NPR 1.23 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2020/21, following a steep fall from NPR 282.41 billion in the previous fiscal year (FY) 2019/20. While economists and experts have credited the ever-increasing imports bill and slowdown in the net inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) for the fall in BoP; fall in foreign employment and foreign earnings too has been adversely impacting the national BoP. In the previous fiscal year (FY) 2020/21, Nepal had recorded merchandise imports of NPR 1,539.84 billion (an increase of 28.7 percent as compared to fiscal year (FY) 2019/20) and a meager FDI inflow of NPR 19.51 billion (during the same review period). Moreover, with the number of domestic migrant workers taking approval for foreign employment reducing by a staggering 62.8 percent, net domestic transfers too have reduced, ultimately reducing the net BoP. Considering these statistics, current account has widened from NPR 33.76 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2019/20 to NPR 333.67 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2020/21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any change in a country’s BoP brings about serious ramifications for the national economy; signaling that the country is operating on a thin line to manage foreign currency in its economic dealings with other countries. In Nepal’s scenario, bloated merchandise and food imports as compared to merchandise and food exports has been ensuing more outflow of money from the economy than money inflows. Similarly, remittance earnings sent by domestic migrant workers (which is a crucial source of foreign currency for Nepal) too is on a downward spiral. With restrictions in international migration for employment and economic opportunities, foreign income has reduced, further reducing BoP surplus. Moreover, disruptions in the tourism industry has also contributed towards a falling BoP. With lesser foreigners entering the nation, the country’s service sector has been recording meager revenue collection. Thus, while foreign employment and foreign tourists (entering Nepal) would take a longer time to return back to normal (owing to the obstructions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic), the government must impose quantitative/tariff restrictions including an import ban on import of high-end vehicles, control on import of non-essential commodities and high tariff on luxury items to offset the fall in BoP surplus and a widening current account deficit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Government remains unguided on issues of labor and employment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prime Minister Employment Program (PMEP) which was launched with much fanfare has failed in reaching its desired target. Brought in by the previous Oli government to create better employment opportunities for the domestic labor force, the program has failed in reaching a consensus among the three tiers of the government. The Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security (MoLESS) which had started the program with a budget of NPR 30 million (3 years back) has spent over NPR 120 million on the project till date. Yet as many as 752,957 individuals across the country registered as unemployed citizens in last fiscal year (FY) 2020/21. Local governments have been reasoned out as the main reason for the failure of the proposed program. With local governments distributing the budget to their cadres instead of investing it in employment creating opportunities including seed for small businesses, establishment of local industries and trainings for skill and human resource development; individuals have remained unemployed with no scope of income or resource generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youths in Nepal account for more than 40 percent of the 20.7 million working population, yet they face the highest rate of unemployment, with 35.3 percent of them facing social exclusion. With the ongoing pandemic making matters worse, the government needs to step up from its previous pragmatic approaches. The government needs to be a more holistic in its approach to promote an entrepreneurship culture where technical skills and human resource development can be imparted. This should be followed by economic and locally feasible models to make vocational training more demand oriented; easing the work transition and movement of youths and individuals from an informal to a more formal setting/sector. Moreover, a stronger national commitment is also needed in ensuring a technically competent public employment system where efforts and concentration can be diverted towards retaining the young labor force rather than losing them to foreign lands.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671169228_KM-Khotang-Majhuwagadhi-1-1536x864.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-08', '2021-09-20', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 17:25:28', '2022-12-16 17:25:28'),

Oli government are now a minority. While on 13 September, the newly-formed CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US)-led by Madhav Kumar Nepal official withdraw its support to the K.P. Oli government. CPN-UML split into two, while the Madhav Kumar Nepal faction formed a new party on August 18.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs per the provision in the Constitution, Article 188 (2), a CM must take a vote of confidence within one month when the ruling party split. As CM of Province 2, Lalbabu Raut also needs to take a vote of confidence as on September 18, Janata Samajbati Party (JSP) also split into two; the group of Mahantha Thakur registered a new party as Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (Loktantrik). Previously, JSP had a single ruling party in Province 2. Now there is a collation government with JSP, Nepali Congress, and Maoist Center. On September 29, CM Raut finalized the date for taking vote of confidence on October 6.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPreviously, except of Province 2, CPN-UML had an almost two-thirds majority and was ruling in the federal and four provinces – namely Province 1, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini Provinces including two collation governments in Karnali and Sudurpaschim Provinces. Now, due to internal political strife, two CMs of Gandaki and Lumbini have already lost their positions. And the remaining two CMs of Province 1 and Bagmati from CPN-UML are also likely to lose their positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Formation of the Periodic Plan Delayed</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The political disagreement of the center has also affected the provincial governments. While six provinces have already formulated their period plans one year ago, Sudurpaschim falls behind. The Provincial Policy and Planning Commission, Sudurpaschim has estimated to take another six months in completing the plan; the commission took three months in hiring staff.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis has delayed the developmental process of the province and concerned local levels. Like all provinces, Sudurpaschim has also completed its four years under a stable government, with just one year remaining to complete its five-year tenure. It is deplorable to see that it may still take six more months to complete a periodic plan that was intended to cover its five years of tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Lack of implementation in Federal Civil Service Bill</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The political strife at the center seems to have affected the country’s administration and service delivery. After a long obstruction, the Federal Civil Service Bill was passed on September 29, 2020; however, the implementation of it is yet to be seen. Due to its lack of operation, there has been an obstruction in the transfer and promotion of employees at the federal, provincial, and local level. The bill was not passed due to the continued obstruction of the parliament from the political parties. According to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration, more than a thousand application letters have been submitted for transfer, but has not been acted upon and affected to the staff adjustment in all level of governments. Such delayed implementation of the required act is hampering the pensions of employees, service facilities, departmental punishment, and acceptance of resignations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Effort on Capital Budget Expenditure</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 22, the newly appointed Finance Minister Janardan Sharma announced to mobilize at least 10 percent of the capital budget, each month. According to the report published by the Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO), Sher Bahadur Deuba-led administration had spent only 0.6 percent of the total capital budget in the first two months of the current Fiscal Year (FY) 2021-22 due to the budget holiday in 2nd week of September. This is the first time the country faced a budget holiday after Nepal adopted the federal system while the recent government failed to receive parliament’s approval through a substitution bill within 60 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per rule, the recognition of the ordinance must be passed by each assembly (Federal Parliament Assembly or National Assembly). On September 23, the National Assembly endorsed the replacement appropriation bill and then the government spent Nrs. 24.35 billion within the last week of September.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, minister Sharma is taking efforts for implementing the budget effectively. Recently, Minister Sharma organized a high-level discussion with the secretaries of the ministries on September 27, and directed to prepare a work-plan within a week for effectively implementing the capital budget. The work plan’s effectiveness is yet to be seen, however, all three tiers of government have been often criticized for lack of implementation despite excellent plans/policies on paper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrequent political commotions coupled with actions of central government has led to disturbances in all levels of governments and its sectors – economic and development activities, administration, and federalism implementation. The center political turmoil from the last six months has still not settled, and Province 1 and Bagmati still face its ripple. Inefficiency and delays may cause citizens to again lose hope from the new government.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671169318_NG_Rupandehi-pradeshpramukh-2048x1442.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-09', '2021-10-27', NULL, '0', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 17:26:58', '2022-12-16 19:12:49'),

Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) which released its 11 months data via the report ‘Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation’ revealed that the country received NPR 870.94 billion in remittances during the period between mid-June 2020 to mid-Luly 2021. The remittance inflow in the last fiscal jumped from 3.2 percent to 12.6 percent to reach NPR 642.14 billion. In terms of USD, remittance inflow increased by 10.4 percent to reach USD 7.39 billion. This increasing remittance earnings was heavily channeled into procuring agricultural imports. The country recorded a 30 percent year-on-year increase to its agricultural imports bill, pushing it to NPR 325 billion in (FY) 2020/21. Department of Customs (DoC) has revealed that the share of farm products in the total import bill rose to 21 percent within the NPR 1.53 trillion bill. This staggering import of agricultural produce was due to high domestic demand for items like edible oil, crude soybean oil, cereals, sugar and so on. Soybean oil was identified as the most imported product whose imports increased from NPR 32.66 billion to NPR 82.90 billion. The increase in import of crude soybean oil has been attributed to Nepal’s import of the same from other countries paying minimum tariffs and then re-exporting it as a refined product to South Asian countries (particularly India) under provisions of zero tariffs (as ensured by the SAFTA agreement). Due to this, in the last few years, refined soybean oil has become Nepal’s top export product, despite lacking competitive advantage in the international market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the import bill also registered a huge rise in import of rice. Nepal imported rice worth NPR 28.60 billion in (FY) 2020/21. The country which produced only 5.62 million tons of rice in the last fiscal (which was an increase from (FY) 2019/20’s produce of 5.5 million tons) has been dependent on rice imports for several years now. Apart from agricultural imports, merchandise imports too have increased in the last fiscal by 25.7 percent to reach NPR 1383.36 billion against a decrease of 15.3 percent in (FY) 2019/20. In merchandise imports, commodities such as transport equipment’s and parts and telecommunication tools and equipment’s etcetera have increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A closer look into the statistics in the report, ‘Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation’ by the central bank has also revealed that merchandise exports has increased by 37.8 percent to NPR 121.25 billion during the first 11 months of the same review period. India has been identified as Nepal’s top export partner followed by other third countries. However, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and the border closure at Kodari-Zhangmu and Rasuwagadhi-Kerung border points, exports to China has drastically reduced by 17.4 percent, reaching even nil at above-mentioned border points. In total exports, export of commodities including refined soybean oil, cardamom, polyester yarn and threads, jute products, woolen carpets and so on has increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the backdrop, Nepal’s trade deficit has inevitably expanded by 24.5 percent to reach NPR 1262.11 billion during the first 11 months of (FY) 2020/21. The deficit has increased from 16.4 percent as compared to the last fiscal. Export-Import ratio too has increased to 8.8 percent in the same review period, which is an increase of 0.8 percent as compared to last fiscal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">An Analysis-</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As of current statistical figures, Nepal’s trade deficit is largely being perpetuated by the ever-expanding agricultural import bill. This is a pressing concern for an agrarian economy like Nepal. While large imports of agricultural commodities are being allowed to continue to meet increasing domestic demand, it is also supporting a bloated trade deficit; ultimately affecting the economic growth of the country. Remittance sent by domestic migrant workers is increasing domestic consumption for fine food products. With increasing income, purchasing power is also increasing; expanding the overall living standard of middle-income Nepalis who are now preferring to consume refined food items. Moreover, easy import procedure from India (where production happens in large numbers) is also making Indian imports cheaper. If allowed to continue, Nepal – a developing and import dependent nation can face greater price volatility (for consumables) in the near future. Likewise, as Nepal’s value of agro import bills is consistently rising above its total value of merchandise imports and exports, the country can also be pushed into a phase of national food insecurity; which can further worsen owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerns are also arising regarding the nation’s weak and inadequate agricultural plan and policies. While the government through its budget had allocated NPR 41.40 billion for the growth of agricultural sector in (FY) 2020/21 and the central bank had mandated for other bank’s lending to the sector by 15 percent (during the same fiscal), all such provisions and promised has fared poorly in its implementation. The government’s 20-year Agriculture Development Strategy along with the 10-year action plan has also failed to produce any concrete results. Similarly, the government had invested billions of rupees to provide fertilizers and plant nutrients to farmers on time during the harvesting season; however, agricultural productivity still remains low. If no intervention is introduced here, low agricultural productivity can enlarge population pressure on limited farming resources, promote uneconomic holdings of cultivable land and poor management of available resources and increase subsistence farming; further skyrocketing the import of agricultural goods, expanding the agro-import bills and widening the overall trade deficit.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671360319_default-img.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-07', '2021-08-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 17:31:21', '2022-12-18 22:30:19'),

The CMP – drafted by a team led by the General Secretary of Nepali Congress – includes the areas in which the government envisions to focus: such as fostering national interest, enforcing rule of law, reinforcing federal democratic system, implementing federalism, ensuring good governance, strengthening foreign policy, and so on. CMP also delves into efficacious enforcement of water resource policy wherein it refers to bilateral and multilateral usage of water resources in the national interest. Moreover, the mobilization of foreign aid will be through the budgetary system in the national priority in building physical infrastructure under CMP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, CMP has not incorporated Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The ruling alliance fails to form a consensus regarding the MCC. The Maoist constituent and CPN (Unified Socialist) of the ruling alliance has been against the endorsement of MCC without its revision, while the Nepali Congress has been in favor of its parliamentary ratification. Meanwhile, the US has been constantly pushing for MCC’s parliamentary endorsement. Fatema Z. Sumar, vice president of the Department of Compact Operations of MCC is visiting Nepal on September 9 to gauge the progress of the project. However, the possibility of the endorsement of MCC has triggered China. The Chinese discontentment regarding the likelihood of Nepal endorsing MCC is amply visible in Chinese media and social media platforms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, CMP aims to peacefully resolve the border row with India through diplomatic channels. CMP, specifically, talks about border issues with India (Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiadhura). It has nonetheless omitted to address the border with China, particularly in Humla. The senior Congress leaders have expressed concerns over the omission of the border dispute with China in the meeting with the PM. The PM had assured to form a high-level task force by the cabinet to study this matter. The left parties have objected the formation of the taskforce to study possible border dispute between Nepal and China. This is an appreciable initiative taken by the government to study the northern border. However, the government should handle the situation diplomatically so as to minimize tension between the two countries. Treaties and border protocols signed between the two countries and the clauses of these protocols need to be complied with while studying the border.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia’s Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) reportedly demolished an improvised cable crossing, which led to a Nepali national to go missing. The Government of Nepal did not give a strong reaction regarding the case. The Ministry of Home Affairs rather admonished everyone to tread cautiously vis-à-vis the case, as it is a geopolitically sensitive issue. However, the spokesperson of CPN-Maoist Centre Narayan Kaji Shrestha broached up the Tuin incident in the parliament and urged the Indian government to apologize immediately for the actions of the SSB. India refuted Nepal’s claim regarding the incident and has been uncooperative in probing the matter from their end. Contrastingly, the media reports based on eyewitness claim that SSB was involved in untangling the Tuin. The probe team finally submitted the report regarding the incident to the government. The report has recommended holding the accused accountable. However, the government has been reluctant to take a stance and disclose the report to refrain from riling India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn assessing the new government ‘s foreign policy and its actions, it appears that the government wants to remain neutral and not take any major decisions concerning foreign policy. The exclusion of the MCC and China border issue in the CMP and the silence on the Tuin incident indicate that Deuba’s coalition government wants to remain in the good books of both China and India. However, while balancing India and China, the government has left the US concerns unaddressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">New Government’s Relationship with China</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The current government has strived to maintain a good relation with China. The government seems to understand that balancing both China and India are crucial for Nepal. The Nepali envoy to China has stated that there will not be any alteration in Nepal’s One-China policy under Deuba’s leadership. He also opined that China and Nepal’s relationship is premised on ‘mutual respect, mutual benefit and a good understanding of each other.’ Further, the Deuba government also aims to accelerate the sluggishly progressing project under BRI. As per several government officials, Nepal and China are in the phase of exchanging draft implementation plans which is the pre-requisite for project selection, budget, mode of funding, and human resource management. Negotiation and execution of the projects are anticipated to start soon. The new government is looking to begin at least two projects under BRI this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">New Government’s Relationship with India</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After the turbulence caused by the border dispute in the Indo-Nepal relationship, both countries are now putting efforts to mend their relationship. The new government has also adopted the ‘Neighborhood First’ policy. The former minister of State for finance and a member of the Nepali Congress stated that China cannot replace India’s special place as a neighbor. Moreover, India’s ruling party’s (BJP) Foreign Affairs Department Chief Vijay Chauthaiwale visited Prime Minister and other political leaders including K.P. Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and Mahant Thakur intending to strengthen ties with Nepali political parties. Further, BJP’s spokesperson stated that Nepal holds strategic importance to India and India is committed to strengthening bilateral relations with Kathmandu.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepal Jammed in Geopolitics</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Nepal is economically dependent on the emerging powers of the world, having geopolitical implications is almost inevitable. Recently, Nepal is wedged in virus geopolitics: the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu stated that over 80 countries, including Nepal, have objected to the attempts to politicize the origin of the virus and call for the Joint Report by the WHO-China joint study team to be enforced. China has been exerting pressure on Nepal to take a stance and put Nepal in a difficult position. Nepal maintains a good relationship with both the US and China. Given the COVID-19 crisis, it needs support from both countries and cannot afford to take sides. Nepal has not formed an official position yet in this regard. Analysts say that Nepal should take up non-aligned foreign policy and remain far from the geopolitical rivalry.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671169759_CKK-KTM-AmbassodorandMinisterOxygenPlanta-1.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-08', '2021-09-21', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 17:34:19', '2022-12-16 17:34:19'),

From opening up of hospitality and tourism services, essential educational and learning facilities to small and large-scale businesses, economic sectors looked relieved on being able to function up to their marginal or in some instances optimal capacity. Tourism sector in particular achieved a new feat by becoming the fourth largest industry across the country by employment. According to findings from Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), tourism industry currently employs around 11.5 percent of the total labour force (roughly around 371,140 individuals) across all industries. This surge in employment was recorded due to high number domestic and international service seekers. Although the sector suffered a major setback owing to closures enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of service seekers at mobile food services and restaurants, short-term accommodation activities to resorts and hospitality business, airlines and aviation services, and beverages businesses has increased; requiring more labour force and labour participation, ultimately increasing tourism revenue and employment prospects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from sectors, ministries and government bodies too ramped up their operations and activities. In line to achieve the provisions and promises made in the new budget for the upcoming fiscal year 2078/79, Ministry of Finance (MoF) approved various proposals and revised regulations such as signing of loans worth USD 150 million with World Bank, approving an investment of USD 10 million by International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Dolma Impact Fund II, alongside revising and easing new regulation related to Foreign Direct Investment in understanding with Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). The new regulation has eased provisions related to entry of foreign direct investment (FDI) and exit of dividends earned by foreign investors in Nepal in a bid to attract more FDI inflows into the country. Considering the fact that Nepal attracts the lowest amount of FDI among other Asian nations (with FDI averaging at 0.2 percent of the gross domestic product over the last decade), the new regulation has been applauded by both public and private sector. The easement is anticipated not only boost investments in industries and other productive sectors but is also expected to help Nepal become a middle-income country and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, provided FDIs reach the targeted areas and sectors of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Nepal also recorded a new export figure. Trade and economic activities gathered a steam in the current fiscal 2020/21 after coming to a complete halt amid the brutal pandemic in the last fiscal. As per the ‘Foreign Trade Statistics’ released by the Department of Customs (DoC), Nepal exported goods worth NPR 121.25 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal, which is an increment of 37.78 percent as compared to the figure of the last fiscal. Similarly, the import figure too has increased, with the economy importing goods worth NPR 1,383.36 billion, an increase of 25.67 percent more than the last fiscal. Considering this, export experts and statisticians are hopeful that the increasing imports and exports aligned with a refined trade system can contribute towards reducing the trade deficit. Moreover, with prohibitory restrictions removed, easement in import of raw materials can ensure more operation, production, employment opportunities and economic returns. Specially in the context of Nepal (which is an import-dependent economy), a boom in imports does create a pathway to widen trade deficit, but at the same time a boom in international trade can be a driving force in rejuvenating an economy. For instance, uninterrupted import of food and beverages item can control any unforeseen domestic food insecurity and help control consumer food inflation. Nepal’s retail and manufacturing industry (which contributes around 14 percent to the national GDP) is heavily dependent on imports from India; thus, higher imports translate to higher employment in this sector (due to it being labor-intensive in nature). Similarly, steady imports of FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) ensures stable government revenue through import taxes. Moreover, import of essential raw materials in industries also secures domestic production of essential commodities like medicines, chemical fertilizers, agro products, and other consumable goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the second wave did threaten many economic recoveries made post the first wave, the economy can bounce back considering the modest estimation on economic growth and development. For this, collaboration between the government, industrial sector and the civil society is prudent in building a concrete effort that can prioritize nation-building post the second wave. If they can come together to curate a new development paradigm, focusing on sector-specific needs (monetary and fiscal), the economy can advance on a rebound track. Moreover, commercialization of domestic markets, provision of lower tax rates on domestic businesses, easy credit and loan score, and a stable business and political environment can also help in facilitating and achieving the revival target.</p>', NULL, 2893, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671360272_default-img.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-06', '2021-07-13', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 18:35:31', '2022-12-18 22:29:32');

In the said report, huge arrears including irregularities in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019/20 were found to be made by the three tiers of government – federal, provincial, local as well as ministries and its bodies. After the federal election, the OAG continuously presented three annual reports; 56th, 57th, and 58th respectively. In all Fiscal Years, average irregularities in the financial amount have been increasing year wise. Reportedly, the arrears and irregularities of the government reached NPR 676.44 billion in the FY 2019/20 – an increase from the last FY’s amount of NPR 664.44. Similarly, the outstanding amount has reached to NPR 418.85 billion in the 58th report, which has been settled by the government. All levels of government spent a huge amount behind the law – such as purchases were made without proof and no billing system was maintained, which contributed to the irregularities, report showed. Irregularities happened not only from the local representatives and political sphere but also due to the bureaucracy. As federalism is new, irregularities from the local representative could be a new challenge for the government. However, the bureaucrats have also been involved in the irregularities, while they have had a long experience of the government system. The ministries’ irregularities appear huge as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Arrears Increasing Every Year</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Report, arrears amount has increased by a large number than last year. Arrears and irregularities are surging every year at all local levels, ministries, and its bodies as showed in the report. For example, the local levels’ irregularities reached NPR 24 billion in the FY 2017/18, compared to NPR 38 billion in FY 2018/19, and now to NPR 41 billion according to the 58th OAG report in the FY 2019/20. Similarly, provincial levels’ irregularities reached NPR 190 million in FY 2018/19, while in the FY 2019/20, it reached NPR 820 million. Comparatively, the irregularities of the provincial level increased four times in FY 2019/20 compared to 2018/19. Likewise, in the federal government, arrear amount reached NPR 44.39 billion and in provincial and local government, it reached NPR 12.66 billion and NPR 40.83 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Where are The Arrears</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 58th OAG report, out of 753 local governments, 147 local governments have expended NPR 76.8 million for the meeting allowance. However, as per the provision, only the members of the judicial, legislative, accounts, and Good Governance Committee are allowed to receive allowance. Similarly provincial government spent a huge budget on the vehicle purchase. Twenty-seven local governments received money from the federal government last year to build industrial villages, but in vain. Another example of arrears is 28 local governments illegally spending NPR 14.38 million for vehicle purchase. Similarly, 47 local bodies have spent NPR 19.07 million in purchase of clothes and attire. Similarly, the OAG report stated that 84 local bodies spent NPR 36.35 million for communication, monitoring, house rent, transportation and fuel expenses, indicating that these transactions made were either personal or way above the market price. Similarly, 131 local levels have illegally hired personal secretaries and advisers to pay them monthly NPR 92.91 million collectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Failed Submission of Audit</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of local governments not submitting audit reports has been increasing every year. According to the OAG, several local governments have not been able to submit and audit report. Reportedly, during the last three years, 6 local levels have not conducted an audit report to the OAG in the FY 2017/18. Similarly, 10 local levels failed in the FY 2018/19, however, 59 local levels failed in the FY 2019/20, the 58th audit report showed. Justifying their delay, several local governments blamed the COVID-19 crisis for not being able to submit to the OAG, their financial report. However, the government was not submitted an audit report in the previous year as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Two Aspects</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is two aspects of the arrears and irregularities over the country. According to OAG, three tiers of government repeatedly ignored the rule provided by the OAG to submit their report, which led to the huge number of irregularities to appear. While another aspect is from the three tiers government, who claim that all the governments are in charge to expend their budget as per their rules. Normally in federal practice, all three tiers of government can spend by making their own rules. Thus, the contradictory laws of the Nepal government is the root cause of misunderstanding regarding arrears and audit report submission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Conclusion</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 58th annual audit report presents that all levels of governments, ministries, and its bodies and committees have spent huge amount by crossing the limitation of rules. The arrears in the OAG pointed out that the public service provided by all the bodies is at serious concern. The provincial governments – the newest form of government – had the opportunity to set a new standard by maintaining good governance and transparency. However, the provincial level also drowned in the irregulars as the center and local government.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Phiroj Chaudhary', '/uploads/banner_image/1671173541_Pro_ktmpresidenti-1-2048x1182.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-08', '2021-09-20', NULL, '0', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 18:37:21', '2022-12-16 19:12:37'),

The Indian envoy met newly appointed Prime Minister at his private residence on July 14 to congratulate him. Followed by the US envoy on July 15 and Chinese envoy on July 16, who also met the PM. However, there was no immediate response from the Indian Prime Minister which was bewildering. India in the past swiftly acknowledged the new Nepali Prime Minister each time. Nepal’s foreign relation analysts have raised concerns over the Indian Prime Minister’s delay in congratulating the new PM.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, on July 19, the Indian Prime Minister, on telephonic conversation, congratulated PM Deuba on winning the Vote of confidence in the Parliament. It appears that the PM’s Indian counterpart was awaiting the result of vote of confidence before extending congratulations. This also shows that the Indian PM was rather dubious about whether Sher Bahadur Deuba would indeed win the vote of confidence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, Australian envoy and Japanese envoy to Nepal separately met PM Deuba at the Prime Minister’s Quarter. In the meeting, Japanese envoy informed that there are efforts being made to bring vaccines to Nepal as promptly as possible. Japan had previously announced to provide 1.6 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines to Nepal through COVAX facility. In the meeting PM expressed gratitude to Japan for the vaccine cooperation and other support in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, various aspects of Nepal-Australia ties along with cooperation to fight the pandemic were discussed in the meeting with the Australian envoy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the change in leadership, there seems to be a shift in Nepal’s geopolitical scenario as well. It is no secret that Nepal, due to its strategic location, has been a battlefield for emerging global powers – India, China, and the US – for a prolonged period. Geopolitical factors have always heavily influenced the internal politics of Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">The US Influence</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the appointment of the new PM, the US has been actively engaging with Deuba and other ministers. The US provided 1.5 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines to Nepal though COVAX. The American Ambassador to Nepal stated that the US will not engage in the vaccine trade to derive political gains – the vaccine provided is a ‘gift’ from the US. This gesture of US is appreciable, nonetheless is indicative of the US’s interest in Nepal, as ‘free gifts’ often come with hidden agendas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, the ambassador also met the Finance Minister of Nepal on July 27. In the meeting, the Ambassador promised to support Nepal in the forthcoming days. He also stated that vaccine against COVID-19 is Nepal’s priority and the US will cooperate and facilitate the import of vaccines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with this, the US is pushing the newly formed government to take immediate action to pass the MCC. Deuba has always remained in favour of ratifying MCC grant. Moreover, the perceived distant relation between Nepali Congress and China has also made it conducive for the US to exert pressure to pass the MCC. The US Secretary of State, Antony J Blinken, as soon as he landed in Delhi made a telephone call to PM Deuba on July 27. The conversation touched upon various matters regarding bilateral cooperation, COVID vaccines and assistance of medical supplies. Besides that, he laid special emphasis on the MCC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal- US relation cannot be seen in isolation. The phone call made by the US Secretary from Delhi holds a significant meaning. It may perhaps be understood that the alliance between US and India is getting stronger. This could have serious implication for Nepal, although a positive one nonetheless. Nepal however, needs to be mindful of its impact on China.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">India Influence</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian Ambassador met newly formed government’s spokesperson/ Minister of Law in Singha Durbar on July 15. The Ambassador recalled the historical ties between India and Nepal and stated that support, cooperation and goodwill between two countries shall be stronger in the upcoming days. India is putting all efforts to strengthen overall Indo-Nepal bilateral ties in terms of diplomatic relation, trade, humanitarian aid and development of infrastructure. Moreover, the ruling party of India has perceived the appointment of a Congress Leader as the new PM as ‘good news’.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia provided 150 ICU beds to Nepal to support the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Indian envoy stressed upon India’s commitment to support Nepal in tackling the pandemic by providing assistance to advance health infrastructure of the country, in a statement released by the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, as per the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Indian PM has assured that Nepal will soon receive COVID-19 vaccines. In a telephonic conversation, the duo talked about bolstering bilateral ties. However, there is ambiguity as to whether he assured early supply of one million vaccines from the Serum Institute of India which is already paid for or is it additional doses of vaccines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, after almost 13 months, India has lifted the ban on import of refined palm oil from Nepal. Industrialists believe that it will take at least a month for the export to resume. Nepal also signed an agreement with Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam to build a Lower Arun Hydropower Project of 679 MW in eastern Nepal. The project will be built under the Build-own-operate-and-transfer (BOOT) model.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">China Influence</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst the heightened US-China rivalry in the South Asian region, China is already apprehensive about the increasing US influence in the region. Further, with the change in the domestic political regime of Nepal and the ruling party’s perceived affinity towards India, China has been anxious. The Chinese Newspaper – Global Times that runs by party line has clinched that Nepal’s new PM is ‘pro-Indian’. Nevertheless, Deuba has stated that his foreign policy will be based upon mutual friendship and cooperation, while maintaining that the relationship with the northern neighbour shall not face any turbulence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina views India and the US in consolidation, as India’s moves are usually supported by the US. The US State Secretary meeting with Dalai Lama in New Delhi on July 27 has riled China. US and India getting involved with Dalai Lama and increasing its influence in Nepal could increase the risk of inducing Anti-China activities in Nepal. This is a great concern for China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina is keeping close tracks of Nepal’s changing domestic political scenario. China is closely observing how the new government takes MCC further. China in the past has constantly pressurised Nepal to not ratify MCC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, China established China-South Asian Countries Poverty Alleviation and Cooperative Development Center in Chonqing City on July 8. 5 out of the 8 members of SAARC have joined this initiative. Three countries that have refrained are India, Bhutan and Maldives. Foreign relation experts have stated that China has come up with this initiative to counter India and enter into the South Asian region. This holds an important underlying geostrategic meaning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChinese endeavor to remain influential in Nepal, is on the brink of failing. For instance, Nepal had signed a Transit and Transportation Agreement with China in May 2016. In April 2018, Nepal and China signed the protocol on implementing the agreement, which allowed Nepal to use seven Chinese land ports for the trade with other countries. However, Nepal and China is yet to formulate a standard operating procedure on enforcing the transit agreement. The transit agreement has seen no progress since then. The status is similar regarding BRI as well.</p>', NULL, 2843, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671174028_RoS_Ktm20210712IMG_65015258-scaled-1-2048x1774.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-07', '2021-08-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 18:45:28', '2022-12-16 18:45:28'),

Among the twenty-three ministers, six ministerial seats are held by women: Uma Regmi (Women, Children and Senior Citizens) from Congress. Pampha Bhusal (Energy, Water and Irrigation), Bodh Maya Kumari Yadav (State minister for Education, Science and Technology) and Sashi Shrestha (Land Management) from the Maoist Centre. Ram Kumari Jhakri (Urban Development) from CPN (Unified Socialist). Renu Yadav (Physical Infrastructure and Transport) from Janata Samajbadi Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The constitution of Nepal 2015, is firmly built on principles of equality and inclusiveness. Article 38 of the Constitution states that women shall have the right to participate in all state structures and bodies on the basis of the principle of proportional inclusion. This principle ensures women an unprecedented 33% seats, guaranteed to the parliaments and all other government positions as well as provision of male-female alternate seat provisions in the highest positions such as President and Vice President, Chief and Deputy Chief of Parliament (in both upper and lower houses), Mayor and Deputy Mayor where two of one must be female. It is for coalition partners to ensure inclusion and the same principle is applied to all provinces, as well as the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Walk to Justice: Ruby Khan and 13 Protestors from Nepalgung</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruby Khan, along with 13 other protestors from Nepalgunj led a peaceful protest demanding justice and truth, after the District Police Office of Banke refused to investigate the case of the suspicious death of Nakunni Dhobi and disappearance of Nirmala Kurm. However, police charged a false case of ‘polygamy’ against the right activist Ruby Khan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per Human Rights Watch, “the police attempted to ‘bargain’ with her saying she would be released if she ended her protest movement during her week in custody”. Mohna Ansari, a former national human rights commissioner representing Ruby Khan said that “Ruby Khan was falsely charged with ‘polygamy’ because she had criticized the conduct of police officers”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the inability to investigate and hold police personnel responsible for abuses has resulted in a scenario where police misbehavior is eroding the rule of law and endangering public safety rather than safeguarding it. Even the Supreme Court did not find any evidence to substantiate the charge and said the police behaved with ‘mala fide’ intent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal is a democratic nation founded on the basis of respect for the fundamental rights of the people. Freedom to peaceful assembly, freedom of expression and freedom to voice discontent are the fundamental rights of citizens enshrined in the Constitution of Nepal 2015. But when the police view any gathering of people as a chance to suppress criticism and detain the peaceful protesters; is a misuse of power and mockery of democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Motipur Incident: Excessive use of Force by Police</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Human Rights Watch (HRW), South Asia division, has demanded the Nepali authorities to independently investigate the incident of police shooting and hold police officers accountable for using excessive force against landless squatters in Motipur Industrial Area in Rupandehi district. According to justices Ishwar Prasad Khatiwada and Kumar Regmi, a separate system consisting of specialists from different fields is required to undertake unbiased investigations into crimes involving its own personnel. The police cannot be trusted to conduct impartial investigation into cases where its own officers are involved. The human rights activist states that the police are not an exception to the rule of law, and they cannot operate without regard for the law. Public will be put at risk if the police are not held to constitutional norms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Discrimination and Deaths Continues Against Dalits in Nepal</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Bhim Bahadur Bishwakarma, a 58 years old Dalit man of Bharatpur Metropolitan City-4 of Chitwan was brutally killed for reportedly ‘wanting to enter a temple’ on the Hindu festival of Dashain. Many locals, witnesses and rights activists have said that caste-based discrimination was what led to the incident. To influence police investigation, ministers have taken the side of a person accused of caste-based discrimination. Involvement of politicians have resulted in police showing hesitation to collect and safeguard evidence and conduct a prompt investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caste-Based Discrimination and Untouchability (Offence and Punishment) Act, 2011, makes it illegal to discriminate against people based on their caste or to treat them as Dalits. Any person found a person found guilty of cast-based discrimination and untouchability can face imprisonment for a term from three months to three years and a fine from fifty thousand rupees to two hundred thousand rupees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of political power to influence the police investigation weakens the credibility of the case. Last year, lynching of Nabaraj BK and 5 of his friends by the so called upper-caste made headline in national and international community. It was reported that, the perpetrators, local authorities including the ward chair and police wiped out evidence of the crime and the area police officer committed negligence in investigating the case. More than a year after the mass murder in Rukum the trial is still going on. Families of the victims are growing increasingly concerned about whether justice will be served.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political parties must take bold and proactive steps to put a stop to injustice and atrocities committed against the Dalits. As per Nepal’s legal commitment to protect the interest of Dalits, Ministry of Home Affair has issued a circular to all district administration offices, district police offices and all police units to set up and operate Dalit-targeted help desks in all Nepal Police offices. Further, Minister Bal Krishna Khand, during that the national conference of Dalit people’s representatives, said that the government will ensure that no citizen loses his life in police custody.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1671174322_AKY-Rajbiraj-ChairYadavb-1536x1151.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-10', '2021-11-17', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 18:50:22', '2022-12-16 18:58:01'),

Interestingly, the ruling parties’ leaders also criticized the budget. The leaders were demanding to amend the budget titles, but the ruling party ignored the opposition’s voice and finalized the budget.

This is not new; the government has been giving priority to Asadhe Bikas since long. Asade Bikas is not new in the history of Nepali economy, however, astounding is that, after six years post the commencement of the Constitution of Nepal 2015 and three and a half years since the instigation of the new local government, the tendency of Asadhe Bikas has not died.

But due to the mismatch of power-sharing in both provinces, Janta Samajwadi Party (JSP) in Gandaki Pradesh and Maoist Center (MC) in Province 2 have been dissatisfied with CMs as they ignored the opposition’s demand in the government. Similarly, after more than two weeks of assuming office, Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba in the federal government is yet to give full shape to his cabinet. Due to the lack of consent among the political parties for power-sharing in the cabinet, has led to the cabinet not being formed yet.

In Nepali politics, political expediency and powerplay has always superseded the rule of law revealing mockery of democracy. Recent political turmoil in the parliament led to a government shutdown. In addition to that, continued protest by the oppositions has led to delay in the approval of important ordinance to tackle punishment for rape and acid attack. The political deadlock led to the ordinance lapsing in the parliament after failing to be ratified within 60 days of being presented to the House. Expiry of critical ordinance leads to legal vacuum. We dissect this issue by connecting it with the recent events of rape cases against minor girls and the incident of out of court settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rape and Out of Court Case Settlement</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased number of cases of rape against the minor followed by series of rape case settlements by the local village authorities, led to the government of Prime Minister K P Oli sign an ordinance on November 2020. The ordinance aimed to amend the laws on sexual violence by increasing the penalty in the National Criminal Code, 2074. The ordinance also stipulated three-year jail terms for those attempting to settle rapes cases out of court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent data has shown the cases of rape have increased against minor girl between 16-17 years. A recent news on settlement of rape case by the local village authorities, against the will of the victim, has also come to light. The practice of settlement of rape cases by mediation has resulted in a young woman committing suicide due to harassment. Out of court rape settlement has also encouraged the culture of impunity for the perpetrator. This impunity not only allows such atrocities against women to continue, but it also erodes public faith in the legal system. Women Rights Activist Tika Dahal, states that “inability to pass these ordinances by the government means that that fewer women will come forward to lodge complaints of rape”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ordinance could have been a positive deterrent measure in minimizing the heinous crime against women and restoring the faith in the legal system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Child Marriage Continued to Rise up the Fiscal Year 2020-21</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent data confirms that 84 cases of child marriage were reported in the fiscal year 2020-21 against 64 in 2019-20; an increase by 31.25 per cent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minimum age for marriage in Nepal for both women and men is 20. Although the Child Marriage was abolished in 1963, the practice is still rampant, especially in the rural areas and amongst Dalit communities. Human rights groups accuse the government for failing to take sufficient steps to end the practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Birth Registration, a Fundamental Human Right</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Child Marriage takes a toll on the young women and their children for life. Most marriages and the childbirths from these marriages remain unregistered. Women from marginalized community – Dalit communities, Musahar and Dom are forced to get married at an early age to ease their parents’ burden. Most marriages and births in these communities are unregistered, and as a result, a large number of people are deprived of education, child nutrition allowance, Dalit scholarship, citizenship and social security allowances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The existing legal provisions stipulate that the guardians must furnish their children’s birth certificates while seeking admission at schools. But children born out of underage marriages are not registered during birth and therefore, have no legal identity. Consequently being denied the right to education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a classic example of how violations of one right can impinge on the realization of other fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of Nepal, 2015. Right to Citizenship guaranteed by Article 10, as a part of right to live with human dignity can be linked with right to equality, right against discrimination, right to education, right to social justice and security. Thus, birth registration is a human right that opens the door for enjoyment of other rights including education, health care, participation, and protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the important aspects of the state obligation from the standpoint of citizens’ security is eliminating impunity and preventing the recurrence of abuse and human rights violence especially against vulnerable and marginalised communities. However, in the absence of good governance, the state cannot implement positive and specific measures in response to its obligation.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Niyati Adhikari', '/uploads/banner_image/1671174709_JS_LAMJUNG-schooljanetayargardaibalika-1536x1152.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-09', '2021-10-29', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 18:56:49', '2022-12-16 18:56:49'),

The government has imposed online teaching and learning,', NULL, '<h2>Digital Divide in the age of technology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID crisis has significantly impacted the education system in Nepal. The government has imposed online teaching and learning, but very few have the access to internet and computers. Even schools seem to struggle with the access of the digital infrastructures. After the decline in COVID cases and transmission, the government eased lockdown and the schools reopened for a short duration in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimated 8.2 million students were distanced from their education due to the lockdown. The government did prioritize the education during the COVID emergency response through remote, virtual and e-learning. To minimize the impact of COVID on students, schools launched different strategic programs and methods like distance learning from radio and TV, with the collaboration with government, non- government and educational institutions. More than 100,000 children from five districts were benefitted from the distance learning launched by the coalition. But, as Nepal is a country with around 6 million school-going students, the class divide have increased after the lockdown. The government’s lack of accountability in providing access towards virtual learning system has further increased the digital divide among the students of government schools and marginalized communities. Even the students from areas with negligible COVID spread – like mountainous, rural and other remote areas – are distanced from their education. The education sector in Nepal has always been centralized and discriminatory as there remains a gap between the education system of city and rural areas. In most places, online education has been a very ineffective substitution for physical education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lockdown has boosted the digital infrastructure and technological empowerment through distance learning, but the access to digitalization is a centralized phenomenon. Even though the internet penetration rate in Nepal is 72%, out of which 55% have access to wireless services and 17% to wireless internet, it remains too centralized. A recent survey showed, among the 29% households that have access to distance learning, only half were using it. Around 40% students of lower classes and 20% of upper classes are not in contact or reach of the school administration. The major reason for the digital divide is the lack of proper technological knowledge and groundwork for e-learning. According to UNICEF Nepal, out of 10 only three children have access to online education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also the government decision to start online registration for the COVID vaccination has highlighted the problem of digital gap among the marginalized communities. This decision has questioned the equitable distribution of vaccination for the vulnerable groups. Many people with limited access to internet and technology found themselves left out and discriminated by the government. The ineffective management of vaccination centers and certification is an evident issue of the vaccination program and now the digital divide directs towards an unequal distribution of the vaccine and marginalization of the vulnerable communities. The current status of digital infrastructure, framework and digital literacy is questionable in terms of access. Thus, the government must ensure the technological accessibility with easier process in order to make the vaccination equitable and successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the marginalized communities and people from remote areas face additional difficulties and are in a more vulnerable position when it comes to the digital gap. The digital infrastructure and access in the remote and geographically vulnerable regions still face lots of challenges. So in terms of both the vaccination program and the education system, the rural and marginalized communities are experiencing neglect from their government. The technological boom is evident during the pandemic but we should be aware of the inequality it might bring.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Lazana Desar', '/uploads/banner_image/1671174990_BSB-Baitadi-Schoolb-1-1536x1152.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-08', '2021-09-21', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 19:01:30', '2022-12-16 19:01:30');

In response to government’s request for help to fight against the pandemic, many countries from Europe and elsewhere including Italy, Denmark, Germany and Ireland extended their support to Nepal. Although, these nations have provided essential medical supplies, Nepal, however, has not received vaccines, which is the need of the hour. Moreover, Amnesty International has pointed out that many countries in South-Asia including Nepal is battling against the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. It has urged the international community to provide vaccines along with other medical supplies to Nepal. It also highlighted that there is a dearth of COVID-19 vaccines in the least developed countries of South-Asia. The Covax program designed to help these countries to achieve equal access to vaccine has failed to fulfil its commitment. The President had sent letters seeking assistance for securing vaccines against COVID-19 to the heads of various states such as India, China, UK, Russia and US. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the officials of President’s office have confirmed that any response of the same has not been reciprocated by the recipient states. Many foreign relation analysts have stated that no response from these states indicate a diplomatic failure and a loss of Nepal’s credibility which is a vital element of diplomacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Vaccine Geopolitics</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since India’s vaccine diplomacy has failed, Nepal like always has turned to China to seek vaccine assistance. China also has been the only one heeding and responding to the desperate pleas of Nepal. Leveraging on India’s failure, China has been generously supporting Nepal with vaccines, trying to tighten its loosened grip over Nepal once again. China has come up with a policy that it would provide visa to only those who have taken Chinese vaccine. Fifty thousand citizens at the northern border received Vero cell vaccine in order to resume trade relation with China. It is mildly imposing its vaccine on countries like Nepal that has close trade relations and shares border. Further, Nepal has entered into an agreement with Chinese Company Sinopharm under a non-disclosure agreement and the supply will start from July 8. China’s vaccine diplomacy is not limited to Nepal. China has been capitalising on the COVID- 19 catastrophe in Southeast Asia to magnify its soft power. It has underlying strategic intentions such as promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative along with its claims in the South China Sea. China pledged additional aid to Southeast Asian countries in overcoming the pandemic on June 6. The US and China, both are trying to increase their influence in the South-Asian region. Chinese Foreign Minister stated that China would immediately put the China-ASEAN Public Health Cooperation Initiative into effect and also strengthen regional public health capacity-building. The US, apprehensive of China’s increasing influence in the Southeast region, has announced to provide 16 million doses of COVID- 19 vaccines to Asian countries on June 19. Nepal is one of the 18 countries who would be receiving vaccine under this. It also announced to provide additional 55 million doses of vaccine to various countries on June 21. However, Nepal is not included in the list of the countries that are directly receiving vaccines from the US while other South-Asian countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan are directly receiving vaccines from it. The exclusion of Nepal from the list of direct vaccine recipients could indicate multiple things. Firstly, the lack of effort from the Nepali envoy to the US in lobbying for the vaccine, which resulted from failed diplomacy. Secondly, the US is displeased with Nepal’s strategic clarity. Thirdly, the US is dismayed with Nepal’s lackadaisical approach towards MCC. Nepali Foreign Minister held a meeting with Indian envoy on June 9. In the meeting, they discussed procurement of vaccines amongst other things as per the Foreign Ministry. Finally, India will provide Serum Institute manufactured Covi-shield vaccines to Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in mid-August. India has so far provided 2.1 million doses of vaccines to Nepal. However, Nepal is yet to receive 1 million doses of vaccine from India which is already paid for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Counter to China’s Geo- Economic Strategies</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>China organised a high-level summit with Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance Ministers of 30 countries in Asia Pacific including Nepal.

Among the most impacted sectors is of foreign employment.', NULL, '<h2>Nepali Migrant Workers in the “New Normal”</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the prospects of many social, economic and political sectors. Among the most impacted sectors is of foreign employment. As COVID-19 hit hard in many parts of the world including the destination countries of Nepali migrant workers, the job market in both Nepal and destination countries suffered to a great extent. Many migrant workers were forced to return home while others were unable to return despite their Visa expiry and job loss. The socio- economic uncertainty got bigger when the lockdown was extended for almost six months in the first wave and two months during the second. The low income families, daily wage workers and informal workers were hit hard by the pandemic coupled with the government’s lack of priority for them. According to the report prepared by UNDP Nepal, “Three in five employees lost their jobs due to COVID-19 in Nepal”. The lockdown imposed by the government was supposed to control the spread of COVID-19 but people suffered more due to the uncertainty looming over the socio economic aspect. As the country was being crippled by the pandemic, the government failed to make a positive impact in both preparedness and recovery as it was busy with the political foreplay. Many migrant workers were stranded in both the home country and their destination countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the country was recovering from the second wave, the government announced its budget for the fiscal year 2021-22. The budget is primarily focused around the upcoming election rather than the critical matters affecting everyday lives. The budget presented by Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel had aimed to create less than 350,000 new jobs in 2021-22 in a job market that is already filled with unemployment. The government has also allocated funds of Rs.12 billion for the training to around 100,000 youths joining the labor force, returning migrant workers and those who have lost jobs. However, its implementation and reach remains questionable. Each year around 500,000 young people enter the job market and with the unemployment brought by COVID-19 youths have turned their focus on foreign employment. The remittances sent by migrant workers are a major source of household income. The attraction of youths is high on foreign employment due to the lack of economic opportunities and political instability in Nepal. Also the Prime Minister Employment Fund that provides minimum 100 days of work in local levels to registered unemployed citizens is of little hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the foreign employment sector also faced uncertainty, as the major destination countries have made vaccination mandatory for anyone trying to enter. The government decided at last minute to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to the migrant workers. The government started administering the single shot Janssen vaccine of Johnson and Johnson from July 19 and double shot Vero Cell, depending on the departure dates of the workers. The migrant workers who will be inoculated with the Chinese vaccine – Vero Cell will have to give a few more weeks for the time difference between the two doses so it might be a disadvantage to the workers. Besides, Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman do not recognize Vero Cell and only Qatar has approved its conditional use. Since the administration of the vaccines, migrant workers are lining up at Teku hospital for the vaccination and certificate collection. This decision has led the migrant workers into more confusion and uncertainty. This situation clearly shows the government’s lack of coordination and emphasis on the migrant workers. The situation of the mismanaged vaccination center at Teku Hospital represents a dark social reality faced by Nepali youths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major destination countries have opened up to let in the migrant workers. Israel has also opened up 1,000 job applications for Nepali migrant workers as caregivers. At one hand, employment opportunities in foreign market are increasing for Nepali migrant workers, but the issues related to mandatory quarantine, hefty sums for zero cost jobs and lack of government’s priority for the domestic job market and the economic uncertainty has pushed the youths towards foreign employment. The foreign job seeking Nepali workers face another threat as many phony recruitment agencies are taking advantage of their vulnerability by charging them huge amounts for false promises of foreign jobs. Also, according to the labour agreements signed by the Government of Nepal and major destination countries like Kuwait, Malaysia and Qatar, Nepali migrant workers will be able to join the workforce in those countries under zero cost policy. This policy states that all charges related to the employment, like two way ticker, insurance, recruitment costs etc. will be borne by the destination country’s employer; but reports of workers going to these countries paying hefty amounts has surfaced. Also, along with the mandatory vaccine, destination countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have made QR code identification mandatory for the workers to qualify for quarantine exemption. However, staying at a quarantine facility in Qatar is expected to cost around NPR 100,000. This report shows the implementation, progress and exposed vulnerability of the migrant workers who are at loss at both home country and the destination countries. Also, the government has made no initiative on the mandatory quarantine for the migrant workers in the destination countries. Government must be responsible to ensure best practices and principles to protect the rights of foreign job seekers.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Lazana Desar', '/uploads/banner_image/1671175167_RoS_Ktm20210712IMG_63915246-scaled-1-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-07', '2021-08-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 19:04:27', '2022-12-16 19:04:27'),

The domestic violence was visibly high during the first wave with many reported cases of Violence Against Women (VAW), and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) among others. This trend of “Shadow Pandemic” also became a major social issue during the lockdown of the second wave. There was a total of 4,448 cases of violence against women, children and senior citizen during the lockdown period of Chaitra 11 to Shrawan 10. While many of the domestic violence cases get lost in the way of reporting, and many fear to come out, the rate is still visibly high in all the provinces. According to the recent study done by WOREC Nepal, many women do not report the cases of violence against them due to reasons like less or no access to legal services, social stigma and discrimination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the many issues reported, few were highlighted in news media and social media like Rupa Sunar’s house-rent case, Indigenous Raute women case and a supposedly suicide case of a newly married woman. These cases are different in nature from one another as the house rent case represented the caste discrimination which is still subtly present in Nepali society, whereas the latter two cases showed the violence against women in different scenarios. However, one thing in common amongst all three cases were the social media and public attention they got which brought forth negativity in the society and in the lives of people involved. While both men and women are the victims of online violence, the majority of the victims are women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Social Media’s Negative Influence in the cases of Gender and Social Inclusion</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The popularity and reach of social media is increasing each day with the increase in access of technology among people but many channels and resources in social media are not an authorized media source. The internet and social media has given freedom to express one’s thoughts, views, opinions and experience, but the social media has brought upon a stream of fake news and personal attacks. A recent survey has found that most internet users in Nepal receive fake and opinionated remarks that are taken as news. In the above mentioned three cases too hundreds of videos and news content were uploaded in social media like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter which were mainly misguiding and manipulative information breaching the privacy of the survivors and their family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlighted and viral cases receive wide range of remarks and opinions from the general public, which has even led to harassment of the people involved. Like in the case of Indigenous Raute Women, their privacy was abused as their photos and videos were posted all over the social media without their consent. Many fake and unauthorized news were published and circulated in the social media while compromising the independent lives of the tribe. Also, in the house rent case, the news pattern and unauthorized remarks brought personal attacks to both parties involved. This case also ignited the social and caste-based misunderstanding among the people. And the final case of death of recently married young woman is representative of hundreds of similar cases in Nepal. The case is still under investigation but videos of interview with the mourning family and in-laws are uploaded in YouTube blaming each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the reports, 603 cases of cybercrime and 52 crimes related to YouTube were reported in the year 2077/2078 in press council. Press council has also been monitoring questionable online news portal but due to the large number of contents and lack of a strong law, many cases of online harassment and information are still rampant. Nonetheless the government has prepared guidelines on social media management to make the networking and use of social media systematic and dignified. The government has made a directive using the authority given by Article 79 of the Electronic Transactions Act, 2063 BS. All social media — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the like — will soon need to register with the Department of Information Technology before they are allowed to operate in Nepal, according to the new social media directives drafted by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. If any social media company fails to register, the new directives allow the government to restrict all access to the platform in question. If Facebook, for example, fails to register, 10 million Nepalese could soon lose access to the website. Once registered, the company will not only need to abide by the rules and regulations, including Nepali laws, but also take down any posts that offend “public decency” and “morality”. The directives offer no clear definition of what these terms mean, leaving it open to interpretation at the hands of the police and the courts. All user data will also need to be handed over to any investigating authorities upon request. However, general public fear that the directives will have adverse effect on the freedom of speech but government officials have confirmed that the directives will only control the incidents of violence and crime and the freedom of speech won’t be compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact of social media news content on the cases of crimes has huge impact on the lives of people involved and the case itself. The growth of unauthorized channels is creating negativity and misinformation among the general public. The lack of a strong and clear policy and/or law is the major reason behind this situation. While the social media has increased the access of information to the general public, lack of monitoring and evaluation has made it hard to control the activities of violence, abuse and harassment throughout online platform.</p>', NULL, 2849, NULL, NULL, 'Lazana Desar', '/uploads/banner_image/1671360215_default-img.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-06', '2021-07-14', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 19:08:46', '2022-12-18 22:28:35'),

However, Government of Nepal, disinclined to enforce a lockdown, announced prohibitory orders instead. Authorities decided to restrict the movement of all vehicles after 8 pm barring those deployed for emergency services while continuing the ban on public gatherings and rallies, and close business houses that attract crowds. However, the decision to restrict movement only during night-time courted controversy from the public and experts alike who called it an ineffective strategy because mobility is highest during the day. Moreover, data on infections supported their argument as cases continued to increase at a consistent rate despite the orders. While authorities defended their decision and said that their aim was to curb people from going out at night and socializing; the ban was lifted in two weeks. Such ineffective strategies, along with consistent lack of coordination among agencies involved, inadequate and unclear strategies for vaccine distribution, and an overall negligence of the lives of people may spell disaster in the face of a possible third wave.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Lockdown effectiveness and impact</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a third wave looms large, cases continue to surge despite prohibitory orders in place. If the past is any indication, cases surge when restrictions are poorly enforced and/or restrictions in place are inadequate, and the public fails to self-regulate. The second wave was particularly devastating for Nepal because of low vaccination percentage among its population and more transmissible and deadlier Covid-19 variants making the rounds. However, authorities only acknowledged the seriousness of the situation when the public had already suffered irreparable loss. Such negligence could spell disaster in the face of the third wave. The lockdowns during the first and second wave demonstrated that such blanket policies fail to take into consideration the social and economic costs. Despite being caught on the back foot various time as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to unravel, Nepali authorities have failed to draw lessons to avoid situations of panic and helplessness by making the pandemic a priority. For instance, the lack of safety nets such as compensation policies and programs for low income families made them all the more vulnerable during the crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Vaccine Purchase and Administration:</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccines have been pouring into Nepal after a vaccine gap that lasted for months. Nepal has received vaccines aid from Japan, while purchasing additional vaccines from China and the COVAX facility. The government also recently purchased 4 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, set to arrive in February. However, ensuring safe, efficient, and equitable distribution of vaccines remains a challenge in Nepal. Vaccine distribution is logistically challenging and must be executed with care and precision which requires a stable and effective health system, as well as extensive planning and coordination among the agencies involved. However, the government as well relevant agencies are grappling with issues of prioritizing groups, administration of the vaccines, maintaining safety protocols at vaccination centers, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Lack of Coordination:</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Highly contagious mutated variants of the Covid-19 virus continue to spread rapidly throughout the country, significantly raising the risk of outbreaks. However, agencies responsible to come up with mechanisms to mitigate the effects of the virus such as the Health Ministry and the Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre are embroiled in a blame game. Lack of coordination among these agencies has become even more apparent as they continue to point fingers at each other for an unclear response plan and inadequate mitigation strategies as a third wave of infection looms. With the availability of vaccines, it is imperative that along with enforcement of efficient safety protocols, agencies involved have a secure and equitable distribution plan, public messaging and awareness on progress on vaccine rollout, and maintenance of health records including inoculation status of individuals, if the mistakes of the past handlings are to be avoided. The efficiency of health workers has also been impacted by in the management of the pandemic. Insufficient resources essential in the handling of the pandemic such as test kits, human resource, oxygen, medical equipment’s as capability development of health care providers is essential to a good pandemic response.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\">Nepalis in Afghanistan</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepalis travel abroad for security jobs and among those are Gurkhas hired by private contractors to provide protection to officials, diplomats, and companies in Afghanistan. They are also among the thousands of Nepali nationals trying to flee Afghanistan amidst Taliban takeover. Nepali officials have said that while the government has made diplomatic efforts to coordinate their evacuation, the process has become complicated as many contractors have been working in Afghanistan illegally and records are inaccurate. While most are security guards recruited by private military contractors, some are laborers and some are undocumented.

While the move will create obvious geopolitical impacts and shifts in the region, analysts suggest possible spillover effects on Nepal as immediate neighbors and rivalling regional powers – China and India—have major stakes in the country. Therefore, analysts have stressed Nepal’s need to remain vigilant and watchful of further developments as war-torn Kabul houses not just strategic domestic vulnerabilities, but also a potential source of major regional security imbalance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite not having direct stake in the issue, Nepal’s neighboring countries have stepped up their engagements amid fears of instability and terrorist spillover. Most notably, the recent engagement between Chinese officials and Taliban leaders amidst United States withdrawal of its troops. On July 28, the Chinese state news media showed China’s foreign minister, Mr. Wang warmly greeting Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the deputy leader of the Taliban. This marked the first time a Chinese official engaged with the Taliban in such a highly publicized manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement put out by the China’s Foreign Ministry, Wang Yi acknowledged Taliban as a major political and military force in Afghanistan that has an important role to play in reconstructing the country. The statement also said that the Foreign Minister requested Taliban leaders to make good on negotiated peace deals and urged all factions in Afghanistan to make progress on reconciliation and establish a broad and inclusive political structure. He also stressed that there should be a push for cooperation between Afghanistan’s neighboring countries to bring peace and stability in Afghanistan. Chinese engagement with leaders involved in an international conflict of this magnitude is unprecedented and has invited international attention. Following the event, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged China’s possible involvement in Afghanistan as a positive development during his visit to India. Russia and China announced that their partnership was the best in history and went beyond military and political alliance. The US and its western allies have issued statements criticizing China of coordinated cyber-attacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina’s move to engage Taliban leaders has also been perceived as to mitigate a possible security threat. While China only shares a small portion of the border with Afghanistan along the Xinxiang province, the area is host to Uyghur extremists that has been operating from the Afghani side. Therefore, a possible spillover is also a concern for China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, China has investment interests in Afghanistan wherein a rare earth element used in the manufacturing of mobile phones has been found. China has been given the responsibility to extract the element along with preexisting deals on construction of roads and other infrastructure with little progress. American presence in Afghanistan had facilitated Indian investments, but Chinese investment of Belt and Road initiative had failed to pick up momentum. However, the withdrawal of all US troops may be the beginning of China’s foray into the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecurity and military sources in India fear terrorist spillover into a fragile Kashmir as Kabul braces for Taliban’s inevitable rise and power capture. Experts anticipate the reemergence of Pakistani terrorist groups like Lashkar- e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and the emboldening of Kashmiri militancy in the region. Furthermore, instability in Afghanistan would plunge the country into chaos which could result in the displacement of Afghans, creating a refugee crisis. Nepal has been host to Taliban and Islamic militant forces in the past and given the largely unregulated border with India and weak surveillance system, Nepal cannot rule out the impact. Analysts have suggested that it is essential that Nepal strengthen its surveillance systems for those coming into and leaving the country, and have also stressed the need for coordination among Nepali security forces to combat terrorism and protect national security. Furthermore, the safety of Nepalis living and working in Afghanistan is also a primary concern in an event of Taliban takeover. With the deadline of US troop’s withdrawal barely a month away, instability in the country could have serious ramifications on regional peace and security as a whole and Nepal may not remain unaffected as long as neighbors – India and China – continue to raise the stakes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn international conference on regional connectivity in central and South Asia was held in Uzbekistan highlighted the growing clout of China and India’s dissatisfaction. India is concerned about land access to Afghanistan, which it says is hindered by Pakistan. It has good ties with Iran and has supported a port in Chabahar, which faciliates access to the sea for central asian countries. India is critical of China and Pakistan, implying Chinese projects of connectivity are not based on economic viability and financial responsibility as they create debt burden.</p>', NULL, 2811, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671176983_19d866357e9b47b1b429136b6f976297-19d866357e9b47b1b429136b6f976297-31ccc946dfb44f49b8574e113bba77f7-1.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-07', '2021-08-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 19:34:43', '2022-12-16 19:34:43'),

As the country continues to reel under the virus, districts like Palpa, Manang, Pyuthan, Syangja, Lamjung, and Bajura have been hit hard by rains. Sindhupalchok district appears to be the most affected, with hundreds of houses under water as the Melamchi River gushed into markets and settlements, destroying houses, displacing thousands of people, with several missing and some possibly dead. The areas affected by floods are also mostly the same areas affected by the 2015 earthquakes. Before the rains, Nepal had seen its worst wildfire season with nearly 2,000 raging fires.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile floods are categorized as a natural disaster, such disasters are exacerbated when areas are plundered for resources and houses and road are built along fragile slopes. Furthermore, mountainous districts such as Manang receiving heavy rainfall and floods, despite being a dry region is worrisome say meteorologists. According to them, the rainfall patterns during the pre-monsoon months of March to May need to be analyzed to understand the cause. However, there is little effort in recognizing these hazards that may arise from a system or its environment, documenting their unwanted consequences, and analyzing their potential causes. Therefore, the loss of life and property is also a display of the government’s failure to plan responses to such disasters despite Nepal being a country highly vulnerable to such geophysical calamities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s daily tally of new infections has been steadily going down after lockdown like prohibitory measures were implemented in the Kathmandu valley and districts showing high levels of infections. However, the highly infectious new AY.1 variant of Covid-19 has also been detected in swabs of infected individuals collected by The National Public Health Laboratory from various places across the country. Earlier in May, highly infectious sub-lineages B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.1 were confirmed in Nepal and found responsible for a new surge in the infection. Public health experts called for scaling up tests especially in rural areas where the outbreaks have been alarming. Experts have also said that infections, severity and deaths should be viewed simultaneously and tests must be scaled up, stressing that while declining number of infections and deaths could be a sign of recovery, when viewed in isolation, these numbers can also be misleading when assessing the overall impact of the virus. However, the government’s plan to conduct mass antigen tests across Nepal to identify clusters and hotspots, failed to receive support from the public. Analysts suggested that, prohibitory orders, fear and lack of awareness among the public is responsible for the poor public participation in the antigen testing campaign.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperts in India and the UK have suggested that the third wave of the pandemic which can hit its peak between October-November is underway, adding that the threat of new strains emerging and causing infections to spread faster also looms large. Such news comes as a major concern for Nepal, given low vaccination coverage, the government’s lack of efforts to diversify sources of vaccines, the complacency of the general public, and extending the lockdown no longer viable. The country is still struggling to contain the second wave of the pandemic and authorities are unprepared in the face of the threat of a third wave. Despite there being many lessons to be learnt from the first wave of the pandemic, the Nepali government resorted to politicking, delayed responses, mixed and false messaging, denial, and lack of serious intent to consider the advice of experts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe double hazard situation that Nepal is currently in has hit the community as health and emergency systems are under more pressure. This situation also runs the risk of an increase in the infections among displaced individuals. As Nepali politicians continue to engage in one upmanship, the Covid-19 pandemic and an unforgiving monsoon continue to wreak havoc in the country, making it difficult to keep an optimistic view of the future for Nepal.</p>', NULL, 2811, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671177177_IMG_20210616_125541-2048x1536.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-06', '2021-07-13', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-16 19:37:57', '2022-12-16 19:37:57'),

The verdict came after PM Oli decided to dissolve the parliament unconstitutionally in December and called for fresh elections. The judiciary body’s verdict will also likely push Oli under a no-confidence vote. Nepal’s political instability comes at a time when its two giant neighbours’ rivalry is increasingly straining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Oli’s allegiance, during his tenure, was with China and he ruined decades-long relations with India. Oli was famous for promoting Chinese investments along numerous sectors and decreasing dependence over India. Therefore, the current political atmosphere of Nepal could be of interest to India. However, India has adopted a ‘wait and watch’ policy for Nepal and has not interfered in the domestic politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, India’s reluctance to discuss the border issues with Nepal after improving relations and a series of meetings is worrisome. Even though Nepal expected that the border dispute will be reviewed during the Sixth Joint Commission Meeting, the only decision made was one million doses of vaccine from India in the form of a grant. Indian PM Modi went as far as not allowing Nepali Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali to call on him during Gyawali’s visit to Delhi. Many argue that India took a step back in resolving disputes after Nepal’s political instability emerged. Modi’s rejection to meet with Gyawali could be an indication of India opposing to Oli’s unconstitutional dissolution of the house and therefore wanted to maintain distance with Oli and his ministers. However, according to Lok Raj Baral, this argument doesn’t hold ground since firstly, paying a courtesy call wouldn’t hurt and secondly, Gyawali still managed to meet with the Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Lok Raj Baral has further added that Indo-Nepal relations cannot be viewed in isolation since China has a huge part to play in the current geopolitical sphere. He even hinted that if the Biden administration is keen, the administration can play a part in resolving China-India relations. This will pave way for a more conducive environment and will be in the best interest of Nepal as well. However, that being said, Nepal must prioritise resolving issues with India on the border front and reduce geopolitical tensions by also lessening the function of foreign powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, China-Nepal relations have also not been at its best. China is visibly displeased about the current political situation of Nepal. This may have caused for some tension in trade between the two countries. With only the Rasuwagadhi border fully operational for trade, around 1,500 containers are stuck on the other side of the border for months. Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Lekh Raj Bhatta described the situation as an ‘undeclared blockade’ by China. With the permission of only allowing 5% of cargo movement daily, the revenue collection at the customs office has also been proportionately affected. Business representatives and traders have heavily suffered losses due to the stranded containers and damage of goods over a year. The ‘blockade’ could be to express displeasure at the party-split (NCP) and is attached to a political agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, PM Oli’s loosening influence in his party and in the parliament after the split of the ruling party in two factions has compelled China to explore for a new leader. The northern block’s attention as shifted to Prachanda as the new Prime Minister even if that implies ‘dispensing’ PM Oli. Prachanda is of strategic interest to China due to his role against the USA’s Millennium Challenge Corporation which China views as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy and a threat to China’s BRI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of India’s expectations from the Nepal, India is interested in seeing a more democratic government but most importantly, the government should be friendly towards India, unlike the NCP. The Western powers’ interest also align with that of India’s. However, including foreign players in the politics will only complicate Nepal’s political process rather than providing some sort of stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid the political uncertainty is the vaccine politicization globally which might have indirect impacts on Nepal. India and China have both committed to provide vaccines to its neighbours under their neighbourhood prioritization policy to increase their influence. This has caused for the nations to rush and get their vaccines approved. Therefore, the vaccine has become a tool for diplomacy and exerting influence. This competition will have severe long-term repercussions on the economy and health of the poor nations which receive these vaccines in the form of a grant and cannot afford to buy them. Similarly, Nepal also relies on these grants and might convert Nepal into a testing lab. The poor countries are much at risk for becoming a political victim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, another repercussion of the vaccine diplomacy as stated by Jagadish Prasad Bista is that the rich countries have bought/ ordered their vaccines which will put poor countries much behind on the list to receive cure for the COVID-19. Demands from underdeveloped countries would be disregarded for a few years even though these countries will be made testing labs. Mr Bista further analysed that the restrictions in the supply chain management and border restriction were a result of political issues rather than actual health considerations while questioning the ‘true realm of globalisation’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, Nepal’s geopolitical stance is very delicate right now and must stead very carefully in resolving its issues with the neighbours. Bringing in another government will not solve Nepal’s issues but a change from within the roots is required. Furthermore, while dealing with external powers, the leaders must most certainly not forget the non-aligned foreign policy and repeat the mistakes PM Oli made— by upsetting both its neighbours, India and China.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671342846_KK-Myagdi1-1536x1025.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-03-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 17:39:06', '2022-12-18 17:44:08'),

Hence, one member’s absence could stop the Constitutional Council from holding the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the new provisions introduced through the ordinance, however, meant that even the presence of just three members, including the chair, was enough to convene the meeting and decisions could be taken based on majority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kathmandu post reported constitutional experts citing the act of Oli introducing an ordinance to the constitution in order to appoint members to constitutional bodies as a “Machiavellian fraud” which disrupts checks and balances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oli’s ordinance allowed the Constitutional Council to bypass individuals such as Speaker Agni Sapkota and take decisions based on majority.

Later, National Assembly Chairman Ganesh Prasad Timilsina criticized Sapkota for taking such a decision without consulting him first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case 1 and case 2 respectively, Sanu Kumar Shrestha and Agni Sapkota both took some form of action in order to delay the respective processes. In both cases, the two received criticism for not consulting others before taking decisions—Shrestha from the deputy speaker and political parties, and Sapkota from National Assembly Chairman Ganesh Prasad Timilsina. Kathmandu Post also published a statement from Timilsina, in which Timilsina accused Sapkota of undermining the importance of the National Assembly. Although Sapkota’s attempt to send back the council’s recommendations failed—as KP Oli’s ordinance allowed the recommendations to be approved later anyways–Sapkota’s attempt to delay the process stood out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, it is clear that there are differences of opinion and motive from different players trying to influence laws in their favor, and each of them use relevant strategies in order to do so. Ultimately, the one(s) whose actions are in line with the relevant laws wins the tussle. However, if they are given the power to easily amend the laws themselves, then that removes the limit to what actions they can carry out.

To the relief of many, the SC decision reestablished constitutional supremacy, but the subsequent political developments have led the country towards an unprecedented political confusion. As of now, the Dahal-Nepal faction of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) have been exercising to oust Oli, who shows no sign of resigning despite his moral defeat at the Supreme Court. PM Oli has made it clear that he would rather face the votes of no-confidence against him within the parliamentary party and parliament. On the other hand, the opposition Nepali Congress (NC) and Janata Samajwadi Party­-Nepal (JSPN) have been patiently waiting and watching NCP’s politics, without being swayed by offers of collaboration from both Oli and Dahal-Nepal factions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major Actors, their Interests, and Strategies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PM OLI: Contrary to a widespread speculation that PM Oli would resign if the Supreme Court reversed his House dissolution move, Oli publicly admitted that his resignation is not on the table. He also made it clear that he will rather face no-confidence motion and stay in the opposition for the remaining 1.5 years if he loses. So it is quite apparent that PM Oli wants to prolong his stay in power, meanwhile also devising strategies to dodge the attacks coming at him. As a part of the same, his faction has already began a horse trading race to solidify his position. Reportedly, he has been trying to lure MPs from the Dahal-Nepal faction by offering them money and/or ministerial posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dahal-Nepal Faction: The Dahal-Nepal faction wants to remove Oli through a vote of no-confidence. Although it wanted to move ahead with the no-confidence motion filed on December 20, due to some legal and political issues, the faction has decided to file a new motion with the support from NC and JSPN. First, the old motion was registered at 3:30 PM on December 20, about two hours after the house was dissolved. Therefore, the Supreme Court’s decision to restore the parliament could mean the first no-confidence motion might not have legal grounds to stand. Similarly, the old motion has Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s name as the proposed prime minister—something that could deter NC’s and/or JSPN’s backing. The faction has been approaching both the opposition parties for support and collaboration to remove Oli. It has also not fallen behind in the horse trading race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nepali Congress: Nepali Congress currently enjoys a special position in the parliament, without which forming a new government (if the NCP splits legally) is numerically impossible. Although the party is still weighing its options and is open to both factions of the NCP, an understanding that only Oli can split the communist party makes NC president Deuba favor a possible coalition with his faction. Deuba’s party opponents, however, perceive a collaboration with Oli as a long-term blow to the party. Nevertheless, the party is waiting for NCP’s official split and, therefore, has not taken up on any offers from its two factions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal (JSPN): Although the party does not have the numerical strength to help form the next government, its support can prove crucial—particularly for the Dahal-Nepal faction. For the same reason, the Dahal-Nepal faction sought JSPN’s support to register a no-confidence motion and form a coalition government. The party sought clarification from the Dahal-Nepal faction about NCP’s status. According to JSPN leader Rajendra Mahato, the faction should provide clarity on the status of Nepal Communist Party and whether/how a coalition is possible. Like Nepali Congress, the JSPN is also divided along its factional line and lacks clarity on its stance; while Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and Upendra Yadav are firm on not supporting Oli, Mahantha Thakur and Rajendra Mahato seem more flexible and, therefore, unclear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Election Commission and the NCP’s Future</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On January 24, the Election Commission (EC) decided to not grant official recognition to either faction of the NCP—ruling that the NCP has not split legally. However, the legitimacy claims were filed again, and the EC is currently in the process to make a decision. The EC’s verdict on NCP’s legitimacy dispute will prove crucial in determining Nepal’s politics and government because it will open up legal avenues to split the party and eventually form a coalition government. Dahal claims that the EC’s decision will be in his faction’s favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of the EC’s decision on NCP’s legitimacy battle, the party’s fate also lies in the hands of the Supreme Court. The court is set to hear a case filed by Rishiram Kattel, who has questioned the legitimacy of Nepal Communist Party (NCP) itself. Because Kattel has Nepal Communist Party registered under his name in the Election Commission, the Oli-Dahal merger was registered as Nepal Communist Party (NCP)—with NCP within brackets. If the SC decides in Kattel’s favor, the NCP could go back to its pre-merger state, where Oli and Dahal will be leading NCP–UML and CPN–MC, respectively. In that case, the politics will be straightforward, as it will a pave path for coalition government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Number Game</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lower house of the Federal Parliament, PM Oli has around 83 lawmakers on his side, whereas the Dahal-Nepal faction has around 90. The opposition NC has 63 (two suspended) and JSPN 34 (two suspended) seats in the Lower House. Because the NCP is legally intact with a clear majority in the parliament (173) and Oli is its parliamentary leader, removing the prime minister without removing him from the parliamentary party leader is almost impossible. In fact, the Dahal-Nepal faction did pick Dahal as the new leader and removed Oli from the party. But after the EC declined to recognize the party’s split and/or offer Dahal’s group a legitimacy, Oli is still the leader, legally. Therefore, the Dahal-Nepal faction has to reinitiate the process of removing Oli, which is very less likely because the deputy leader, Subash Nembag, who has the authority to call a meeting for the same, belongs to Oli’s faction. Besides, keeping the party united is no more a priority for either faction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other option is to wait for the EC’s (and the SC’s) decision and hope for NCP’s legal split. Both factions of the NCP will then try to bring Nepali Congress into confidence to form a new government. The Dahal-Nepal faction may form government with NC’s support by offering Deuba the prime minister post. Although Oli could do the same, getting the entire Nepali Congress party to support him could prove challenging. What could also happen, though, is an agreement between Oli and Deuba for an early election; if Nepali Congress does not support either of the NCP factions, the failure to form a government will automatically dissolve the parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Next?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the court’s order to begin parliamentary sessions within 13 days, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has summoned the House of Representatives on May 7, 2021. If the Dahal-Nepal faction ends up forging an alliance with Nepali Congress and/or Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal by then, it will register a new vote of no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Oli. If that happens, the EC’s or SC’s verdict on NCP’s dispute may end up being unimportant for government formation. Like senior advocate Chandra Kant Gyawali argues, if a proposed name on the no-confidence motion gets enough support, “he does not even need to be elected the Parliamentary Party leader to become the prime minister.” If the EC does make a decision and NCP splits before the parliamentary session resumes, Nepali Congress will be decisive in forming the next government— with Deuba being the most likely next prime minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SC’s decision to reinstate the House brought the country’s derailed democracy and rule of law to a track. The move restored people’s faith in constitutional supremacy and democratic mechanisms to some extent. However, the political parties and leaders have failed to fulfil their responsibilities as democracy’s gatekeeper. Owing to a personality-driven political culture, where leaders form factions within parties to fulfil their personal interests, no party has been able to form a clear vision or stance on the country’s current political mess. They all seem to be waiting for the perfect time to benefit from the evolving political scenario. As a result, most political questions that could have been solved through negotiations and dialogues are going to the court—a practice that is not ideal for a representative democracy. Not only this even the role of the Election Commission, an autonomous constitutional body, has received criticism due to its delay and confusion in settling the NCP’s dispute. The EC’s indecision has invited frequent interventions and pressures from even the sparring parties—both Oli and Dahal-Nepal faction. What the EC decides and how the NCP factions react to the decision will shape Nepal’s politics and governance in the days to come. If the opposition parties’ prolong their indecision, they may end up losing a rare opportunity to reestablish their authority in the parliament.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Mahesh Kumar Kushwaha', '/uploads/banner_image/1671343668_RS_KTM_20210223_d-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-03-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 17:52:48', '2022-12-18 17:54:23');

Nepal as a country in South Asian region cannot', NULL, '<p>Summary<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe US has been tightening its grip in the South Asian region alluring the countries with additional financial assistance. Nepal as a country in South Asian region cannot remain unaffected of the US assertion and has already received a huge commitment under the MCC. However, Nepal should have a coherent foreign policy in projecting its national interests and agreeing to regional pacts and agreements including China’s BRI, India’s neighborhood policy, and Japan’s open and free indo pacific.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChange of guard very often and a short-lived coalition since the restoration of multi-party democracy in 1990 deterred peace and development. The people, in the recent elections, expressed their votes in support of political stability. The votes gave a majority to the newly formed NCP after merger of erstwhile UML and Maoist Centre. As the party still struggles to complete the merger process, it has been well established that sustaining political stability would require cohesion within the Nepal Communist Party. Unfortunately, however, it seems to be failing due to internal feud among NCP leaders. This has hit all aspect of Nepal’s governance system, international relations, and has also deterred policy departure in terms of delivering services. The two-thirds majority government formed after decades of short-lived coalitions, which was expected to focus on peace and development, is missing those goals every moment.[1]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe withdrawal of the Guthi Bill following massive protests and not having much to boast of the recent Europe tour, the Prime Minister seems to have been losing his aura; at the same time weakening him, pushing him to be defensive, and scared of losing power anytime.[2]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe fiasco behind the IIFA awards is another setback to Oli’s government which has been backtracking on many occasion for not holding consultations with partners. The government has been facing same fate on many controversial ideas including the Guthi Bill, the Media Council Bill, and many more.[3] Successful hosting of the IIFA awards would have benefitted the prime minister in utilizing the platform to profess closer ties with India, but this dream has currently come undone with the cancellation. Many in the ruling party have seen Chairman Dahal to be behind the cancellation of IIFA in Kathmandu, while others believe that it happened because PM Oli has developed a habit of acting unilaterally. Various recent decisions, taken in rush without any assessment of the in-house mechanism to deliver, defend, and execute has degraded the trust on the government with each passing day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmid the current diplomatic situation of Nepal, the country is trying to balance its relations with its neighbors and the western powers by making efforts to stand by its commitments. The changing political and economic way of engagements of India, China, and the US in Nepal have created a situation where Nepal has to officially organize the dialogue giving importance to all three countries. It was a smart diplomatic move of Nepal to have a foreign policy orientation when it is struggling to engage with China, India, and the US simultaneously. Nepali leaders maintained their neutral positions during the event by stating Nepal’s foreign policies to be pro-Nepal, keeping its national interests in the center.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the change in governance structure, from unitary to federal, the budget expenditure trend remain unchanged as most of the capital expenses happen around the end of the fiscal year, during the monsoon. The recurrent expenditure would always be exhausted despite the minimal capital expenditure. The upsurge in capital expenditure towards the last months of the fiscal year remains a regular phenomenon. A policy departure, on improving the expenditure pattern with the recurrent expenditure tied up with the capital expenses and early start of the procurement process is yet to be practiced in the country, without which the country’s dreams of sustainable growth and prosperity shall remain unfulfilled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, the troubled relations between the outlawed Biplab party and the government remains unchanged. Talking about forceful containment of the outlawed party and tagging them as terrorist would mean endangering peace rather than sustaining it. The former Maoist party who is now in the ruling party, no one else other than them would understand it better. The actions of the government in this regard is much of a personal ego in between the home minister and leader of the outlawed party. The government should justify its intention on banning a party in a competitive multiparty democracy that the country has been practicing for three decades now. At the same time, the revolutionary force should also make its space in the open political culture that the country is in in the recent years. The government, specifically, some of the leaders, may have vested interest fulfilled from the vengeful relations, but there is no way that either the country or the countrymen would support an armed struggle once again. The government should take heed not to fuel one. No to securitization and aggression yes to talks and negotiations for peace should be the way forward.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInternational Relations<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.1 The US Aid Allure: In a bid to strengthen the Indo Pacific Strategy, Trump administration has announced additional financial assistance to South Asian countries. An additional USD 30 million has been allocated for the South Asian countries-Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Maldives-under ‘Bay of Bengal’ security initiative as foreign military financing in addition to USD 64 million that the US committed earlier. The sub-committee of the House of Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the US Interests in South Asia and the FY 2020 Budget on June 13. The US is doubling its fund to USD 468 million for 2020 for South Asia’s economic and regional assistance. Alice G Wells, Senior State Department Official for South Asia, said the US along with India, Japan, Australia, and other trusted allies will work together for economic and political autonomy of IPS.[4]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChandra Prakash Mainali, general secretary, Communist Party of Nepal, has said that the Indo-Pacific Strategy is an attempt to contain China. He further added that the US had no consultation with Nepal and announced that Nepal is a part of Indo Pacific Strategy.[5]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe US will continue to increase its economic assistance in the impoverished regions in support of its strategic move in the Indo-Pacific.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.2 PM’s Europe Tour: PM KP Sharma Oli’s recent Europe visit turned out unfruitful and so had a little justification.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPM Oli left for his 8-day Europe visit on June 8 aiming to boost economic relation with the European countries. Oli left for the tour after the government presented its budget, policy and program for the next fiscal year. The PM was to attend centennial programme of International Labour Organization on the 9th and 10th in Geneva. On June 10, the PM attended a program at Oxford University Union and met the British PM Theresa May on the 11th, followed by a meeting with Norwegian PM.[6]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the Oxford Union Oli said ‘Nepal has established the foundation for a non-discriminatory, inclusive, and participatory democracy for socio-economic transformation’, but the public societies here in Nepal denied Oli’s claim for a democratic Nepal.[7]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe PM claimed reviewing the 1947 tripartite agreement signed between the UK, India, and Nepal regarding the Nepalis serving in the British and the Indian army. Though Pradeep Gyawali confirmed about Oli’s discussion with outgoing PM Theresa May on the subject, the Gurkha leaders were unsure about Oli making any proposal to the UK, as it wasn’t mentioned in the statement from 10 Downing Street.[8]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe PM’s foreign policy adviser, Rajan Bhattarai, tweeted that forces inside and outside the country are intent on repeating history and are actively trying to channelize the popular discontent against the government.[9]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPM Oli seems to have lost the tuning and is not heading towards the right direction as per the regional as well as diplomatic moves. He has been wandering to South Asian countries and then to Europe portraying himself as a regional leader and enjoying the fallacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt a time when Modi 2.0 is pushing the neighbor first approach when the northern neighbor China is getting closer to India and Russia, it is high time for Nepal to adjust the tunes rather than wander around.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.3 India: Despite Nepal wanting to share the Eminent Persons’ Group Report, the Indian side remains reluctant till date. Competing the proposed rails from China to Kathmandu, India’s Raxaul to Kathmandu rail seems to be making inroads to Nepal. The fiscal budget with increment of grant and aid by 178% is an indication of Indian engagement in Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a new trade agreement between Nepal and India, Nepal Railway Company will use its own cargo to import from third countries, extending the railway service by adding Dhamra and Mundra ports in Odisha and Gujarat respectively. The railway cargo service will also reach Bhairahawa apart from Biratnagar. There has been an agreement to also permit the private sector in the transit trade.[10] Sources in the Indian government said that India has finalized and submitted the ‘pre-engineering and traffic survey report’ of Raxaul-Kathmandu railway to Nepal. The report said, the DPR will take 2 years and the construction would take another 5 years for construction of the.[11]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPM Oli said that Nepal wants to create an environment so that the EPG can submit its report to Nepal and India. Constantino Xavier, a research scholar with Brookings India said “Delhi shouldn’t fear the debate” and should “make the report public.”[12]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndian Ambassador for Nepal Manjeev Singh Puri handed over a cheque of Rs 1600 crores to the secretary at the Ministry of Finance Dr Rajan Khanal to support 50,000 beneficiaries in Nuwakot and Gorkha for post-earthquake reconstruction. The government of India partnered with UNDP and UNOPS to provide socio-technical assistance to rebuild shelters in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts.[13] India increased the allocation for Nepal from an actual disbursement of Rs 376.61 crore in 2017-18 to an estimated Rs 1,050 crore in 2019-20 – a boost of 178%.[14]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite strained relations following the Indian blockade in 2015, the increment in grants and assistance, trade facilitation, and progress in Raxaul-Kathmandu railways have been symbolic as India’s attempt to win the heart of Nepalis. However, the row regarding the import of vegetable and fruits on the pretext of heavy use of pesticides seems have disheartened the Nepalis en masse.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.4 Nepal-China: The US will become a major factor in determining to what extent India and China can work together in Nepal.[15] Nepal is simply being ignored in most of the world forum. This could be an indication of the Oli regime losing the frame.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal was not a part of the recent Boao forum. Likewise, Nepal, a dialogue partner, was not invited to the 19th summit for Shanghai Corporation Organization (SCO) that was held on 13-14 of June in Kyrgyzstan.[16] The summit was a key in deepening interaction between regions, strengthen fight against drug trafficking, and establish cooperation in information technologies, environmental protection, health care, and sports’.[17]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina hosted the China-South Asia Media Forum on June 11 to integrate ‘stronger media cooperation for the people-to-people exchange’ in Yuxi city. During the event, Madhav Sharma, press advisor to Nepal’s President Bidya Devi Bhandari, said Nepali and Chinese media should address the national interest servicing public rather than fulfilling exclusive interests. Krishna Murari Bhandary, executive chairman of Gorkhapatra Corporation of Nepal, said South Asia depends too much on foreign media for any global and regional issue and that the South Asian media should have their own perspectives.[18] Nepal’s envoy to China, Leela Mani Poudyal said Nepal seeks China’s help to promote access to Chinese market by transferring technologies and enhancing production capacity.[19]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpendra Yadav’s Federal Socialist Party (FSP) has suspended one of its members of the federal parliament, Pradip Yadav, for taking part in an event supporting Free Tibet movement in Latvia.[20] Party insiders said the party had come under immense pressure from China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn an incident over China restricting entry of Humlis in Tibet, Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote to authorities of China for easy access of Humla residents to Taklakot in China. Nepali authorities requested China to ensure a suitable working environment for them as well. However, Nepal has not mentioned anything about the incident regarding a Nepali man who was arrested for murdering a Chinese women following which China prohibited Nepalis to enter the region.[21] Following the request, Chinese authorities eased the entry.[22]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the ‘One China Policy’, Nepal remains firm. The event of suspension of lawmakers from their party is a gallant example of Chinese pressure in the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.5 BRI: China has confirmed that Bangladesh is a part of the BRI. There were doubts as Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar-Economic Corridor (BCIM) did not appear on 35 corridors mentioned during the 2nd Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in April.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe information released in the red book on June 4, states that China will be providing a grant amounting USD 2 billion for either cross-border railway or two internal railway links. It is not yet clear on which projects the grant will be spent.[23]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrade imbalance with China is growing after the opening of the Rasuwagadhi-Kerung transit. While imports from the transit have more than doubled in the last year to Rs 43.24 billion, Nepal’s export has dropped 25 per cent to Rs 1.16 billion.[24]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe widening trade gap between Nepal and China is a concerning issue. Although trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity including cross border rails was part of the joint communique, no allocation of budget for the rails, except a grant from China in the upcoming budget, indicates low level of commitment from Nepal. With the increasing trade imbalance with china, it is high time that the government kick-started export-oriented businesses in the country. Or else the futuristic connectivity will be of no meaning in terms of trade, and the country fails to capitalize the shift from land locked to land-linked, after China allowed Nepal to reach to third countries through their sea ports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.6 Nepal-China-US: Nepal, a dialogue partner of SCO along with countries like Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Azerbaijan, was excluded from an invitation for the SCO summit this June. Russia and China share interest to curb the Indo-Pacific strategy in Nepal and have found themselves combining their deterrence strategy.[25]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the increasing alienation from the US, the SCO saw scope for greater cooperation between China, Russia, and India. If the three countries make serious advancements in negotiations, this could mean that Nepal a country which has often claimed to be ‘a yam between two boulders’ could stand to benefit from two mammoth economies in the next door.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.7 Foreign Policy Dialogue: Nepal streamlined its foreign policy objectives around economic agenda. The Foreign ministry proposed fine tuning of Nepal’s foreign policy to realize the goal of prosperous Nepal and happy Nepali.[26] The recently conducted dialogue is a stepping stone towards the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal organized ‘national dialogue on foreign policy’ to formulate Nepal’s foreign policies on 29th of June. The dialogue was first of its kind after the current ruling government came into power. This dialogue program aimed to clarify Nepal’s potential to rightly fit in current world situation.[27] The dialogue witnessed themes titled “changing geopolitics: neighbors and major powerful nations”; “orientation on economic diplomacy and priorities”; “regional and multilateral affairs and new challenges”; and “climate change and labor migration.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe essence of the dialogue was to present Nepal’s national interests, particularly economic, are incorporated in the country’s foreign policies, and the country formulates the policies without any bias.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB. Security and Strategic Affairs<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB.1 Biplab: The outlawed outfit seems to have strengthened to carry out an armed aggression against the state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNCP (Biplab) spokesman Khadak Bahadur Bishowkarma (Prakanda) informed through a press release that Padam Rai of his party has joined the ruling NCP. [28]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKathmandu district in-charge Maela Lama absconded after bomb blasts in Kathmandu that killed four Biplab cadres and injured seven others. Nepal police is on his hunt and later arrested Motidhan Rai, Bhupendra Gharti, Bindu Kumari Kuekela, and Sandhya Devi Pun.[29]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReports claimed that the party operated sudden and suspicious activities in Solukhumbu district. Security agencies claimed that 20-25 Biplab cadres attacked and tried to take control of the police post of Chheskam village of Mahakulung Rural Municipality-3.[30]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn June 25, unidentified people set two ward offices in Dhakari and Panchadebal Binayak municipalities on fire. An improvised explosive device (IED) was also detonated at the liaison of the Upper Karnali Hydropower Project on June 8. Police suspect involvement of the Netra Bikram Chand-led Biplab Party behind these attacks.[31]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFour cadres of Biplab-led CPN fired at the police during a chase. In retaliation, Sarlahi, district in-charge of the CPN, Kumar Poudel was killed on the spot while three others fled the scene.[32]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA team of metropolitan police crime division and Kathmandu police arrested Biplab party cadre and film producer Nara Bahadur Karki. [33] Police also arrested NCP-Biplab cadre Kansa Dhimal, convicted for looting Rs. 7.50 million from a bank 10 years ago. Police confiscated two automatic pistols, four magazines, and 14 rounds of bullets from him.[34] Likewise, police arrested cadres from Rukum district. The arrested are secretary of Triveni rural municipality, Chhabi Lal Dharti, Bibek B.K, Dirgha Raj Gahatraj, and Gorkhe Kami.[35] Another Binod Sonam has also been arrested. [36]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContinuing with recent trends, there has been an increase in explosions, bomb hoaxes, life threats to elected representatives, cross-firing with government security personnel, and other activities including a general strike. The incidents have indicated at another armed struggle in the offing. However, it all connects to feuds in the NCP in dealing with the outlawed party. The home minister, with a subtle unseen support from the prime minister is all for a forceful containment, which will be a wrong course of action, as Nepal’s recent political history of Maoist insurgency suggests the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB.2 One China Policy: From not having provided any form of documentation to Tibetans for the past twenty years, surveilling their areas in Nepal, to now even deporting a so-called Tibetan agent, Nepal is on a path to be dubbed as China’s ‘client state’. However, there still remains some hope that the Nepali leadership will be able to draw lines between Nepal’s security and strategic vis a vis upholding of human rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn June 24, a US citizen Penpa Tsering was refused entry into Nepal on the grounds that his name was on China’s most wanted list, and the Chinese authorities had requested Nepal to stop his entry. However, it was discovered later that the name was confused with other Penpa Tsering who used to be the speaker of Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile. Penpa was said to be involved in anti-China activities, a firm follower of the Dalai Lama, and an advocate of free-Tibet movement.[37] The American Embassy issued a statement demanding clarification on why the US citizen needed permission from foreign governments to enter Nepali territory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal has historically been a tolerant space which has recognized and respected Dalai Lama’s spiritual presence and has even had a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ to hand over all illegal Tibetan refugees to the UNHCR. The deportation of Penpa Tsering indicates that China now occupies a decision-making space in Nepal. Nepal must exercise caution in its efforts to please the northern neighbor as rash decisions and actions may lead to a serious transgression with its partner countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC. Gender, Inclusion, Human Rights and Press Freedom<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC.1 Press Freedom and Human Rights: One after other, the Bills that the government tabled have caused widespread uproar among stakeholders. Controversial bills created tensions in the federal parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than half dozens of controversial bill are registered in the federal parliament.[38] The Federation of Nepali Journalist (FNJ) announced third phase of protest against the controversial Media Council bill. FNJ will carry out whistle march, lantern march, cartoon exhibition, and signature collection campaign against the Bill.[39]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ruling party and the main opposition are stuck to their stance on those Bills. The Media Council Bill for the past few months and the Guthi Bill recently have become the bone of contention for the political parties. When Prime Minister Oli was addressing the Oxford Union during his tour, confirming his belief in democracy and freedom of speech as crucial element for a country to prosper, journalists and human rights activists back home were demonstrating in Kathmandu, pressing for withdrawal of Press Council Bill and Information and Press Bill and use of force against the peaceful protesters against the Guthi Bill, in an ironic turn of events.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC.2. The Guthi Bill: The NCP government has learnt a lesson that a two third majority government does not mean that the voters have submitted to every move of the government, right or wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the last week of April, the Guthi bill was registered in the National Assembly. Nepali Congress obstructed the HoR proceeding against the government amendment on the Bill.[40] As per article 23 and 24, all trustee rights would be immediately terminated once the Bill is enacted. There are more than 2,335 public guthis under the Guthi Sansthan-a government corporation that manages them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the PM was wandering in Europe, massive protests in Kathmandu was going on against the government’s move to control Guthi through the new legislation. Kathmandu valley Newars warned of a shut down if the government did not withdraw or revise the bill.[41]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the contested bill propelled massive protest in Kathmandu, riot police used water cannons and charged batons to disperse cultural experts, heritage conservationists, locals, and stakeholders.[42]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, lawmakers of the ruling party also criticized the bill. Lawmaker Pampha Bhusal and Anjana Bishankhe criticized it at the parliament meeting on June 10.[43] Lawmakers from NC and RJP-N also demanded the withdrawal of the Bill. NC lawmaker Prakash Man Singh said the bill was against the spirit of Nepal’s Constitution while RJP-N lawmaker Anil Kumar Jha urged the government to go for comprehensive consultation with stakeholders.[44] Even if some leaders are in favor of the bill, most of the former Maoist leaders are critical of the government’s stance.[45]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRashtriya Prajatantra Party (United) co-chairs Pashupati Sumsher JBR and Dr. Prakash Chandra Lohani said they would go for street protest if the government didn’t withdraw the bill which represents Hindu and Buddhist cultures.[46]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt a press conference in Chitwan, Chairman NCP co-chair Prachanda made a face saving remark that the government will go for consultation with the stakeholders and make revisions on both the Media and Guthi bills.[47] After a widespread criticism, the government signaled a revision in the Bills. [48]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protest in Kathmandu, against the legislation to regulate the Guthis, did not only press the government to withdraw but also taught a lesson to be cautious on such matters in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC.3 Transitional Justice: As the government intentionally delays the transitional justice process, an issue has gone to the High Commissioners Office in Geneva indicating an international pressure in the days to come.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFormer Maoist child soldier, Lenin Bista filed an application at the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva demanding justice for the thousands of child soldiers during the Maoist insurgency. Earlier, in the second week of April, he filed a similar petition with Virginia Gamba, Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict, in Belgium.[49] Among the 4,008 disqualified combatants, 2,973 minors were disqualified during the verification process conducted by United Nation Mission in Nepal in 2007. They didn’t receive any substantial support, except few thousand rupees from the UN.[50]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, at home, on June 10, meeting of Transitional Justice Recommendation Committee failed to finalize the names of nominees for the two transitional justice bodies. The next meeting on June 23 turned futile as well.[51]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTransitional Justice Recommendation Committee meeting has been postponed again. Om Prakash-led committee failed once again to nominate the names of office-bearers for the two justice commissions, TRC and CIEDP. Political bargaining and power-sharing remains the reason behind the delay in deciding the leadership. [52]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamilies of martyrs, injured, and disappeared persons during the decade-long insurgency in Province 2 accused local government province for discriminatory behavior while distributing different facilities. They warned of agitation in all eight districts of the province if their demands are not met. A total of 28 persons lost their lives during the Maoist conflict in the district while seven persons are still missing. But the provincial government is only focusing to the families who lost their close ones in Madhesh agitation.[53]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal government failing to complete the fulfillment of positions in the justice bodies will allow playing field for the international community. The government, in consensus with the opposition and the war victims, should sort the deadlock out at the earliest possible for a respectful position for the country with regards to transitional justice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC.4 Tharuhat Movement: Tharuhat movement is catching momentum once again as they have increased their preparatory activities for the National Summit in August. Tharu leader Laxman Tharu is travelling across districts meeting political leaders and activist to make the summit successful. However, Tharu Welfare Society is turning away from the movement saying that the summit will create disharmony among communities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the Tikapur Incident, the Tharu activists remained silent until the release of Laxman Tharu. The movement, however, may be failing due to lack of co-ordination among leaders and leading organizations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, lawmaker Resham Chaudhary, convicted of Tikapur killings, was seen chained while receiving treatment at Bir Hospital. The picture on social media received innumerable flack, forcing PM Oli to instruct the police to remove the shackles.[54]1. Leaders, including former PM Baburam Bhattarai, Rajendra Mahato, Tharu activist and actress Rekha Thapa, visited the hospital and decried the inhuman treatment. Leader Mahantha Thakur said the extreme mindset of the rulers in Kathmandu towards Madhesh, Tharus, and indigenous people is yet to change even after repeated protests and movements.[55] A lawmaker, though convicted, cannot be chained on a hospital bed is a shameful act and shows the government’s bias against the minority.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC.5 Employee Recruitment: The employee recruitment process for local governments as per a vacancy announcement of the Public Service Commission moved ahead as per plan after facing a few hiccups.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParliamentary State Affairs and Good Governance Committee ordered cancellation of hiring process that the Public Service Commission recently announced for recruitment of staffers in the local governments. The committee claimed that the announcement was against the principle of inclusion and the constitution. The committee directed the Ministry of the Federal Affairs and General Administration to consider principles of inclusion in all of its recruitment processes.[56]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing widespread criticism, both the ruling party and opposition parties spoke against the hiring process claiming that it violated the provision of the Constitution.[57]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA joint student struggle warned the government to correct the vacancy notice of the Public Service Commission with due consideration principle of inclusion.[58]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA recent Supreme Court decision stamped a go ahead for the PSC on its recruitment plan. The rule of law is a key to liberal democracy, which has been upheld in this case. Article 227 of the Constitution provisions reservation quotas for marginalized groups in Public Service Commission recruitments. The parliamentary committee advised the commission to withhold the process. However, the court’s decision gave a go ahead. The provinces have been deprived of the constitutional rights of employment recruitment as provincial public service commission is yet to be formed for lack of relevant bills which is being discussed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC6. Child Marriage: The impact on child groom hinders not only their childhood but forces them to take responsibilities which they may not be aware of and not be prepared.[59] Even the child grooms experience a lot of complications similar to child brides. Child marriage destroys their future- both boys and girls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast month Province 2 State Min­ister for Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment Suresh Mandal assisted and paid for a wedding of a 14-year-old girl Dalit girl from Siraha. This is not the first time that he has done it. He has been endorsing by saying that helping and paying for wedding ceremony for poor Dalits is not a crime. The minister has weakened the Save Daughter, Educate Daughter campaign of the provincial government.[60]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA UNICEF report on child marriage among boys, ranked Nepal tenth highest and is the only country in South Asia with a major prevalence of child marriages among both boys and girls. Globally, 115 million boys and men were married before age 18.[61]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite international commitments, the government failed to bring about changes. The government should enhance awareness programs on consequences of children’s future especially in the Terai as the practice is still booming. With more research, investment, dedication and empowerment from the government, impetus could be created in ending the practice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC7. Demographic Dilemma: Data received from United Nations has indicated that the current population of 28.6 million in 2019 will reach 36.45 million in 2053, but will decline to 27.3 million by the end of the century. Declining fertility and rising life expectancy will affect health, education, social security, labor market, and economic growth of the country due to decreased labor force participation. Further a study in 2017, found that 117 boys were born for every 100 girls.[62] It shows an increase in sex-selective abortion in the past few years. The skewed boy girl ratio, though the effect is not visible immediately, has unwarranted consequences such as partner crisis and sexual violence against both men and women. When gender ratio gets imbalanced, its outcome almost always affects the next generation, causing a direct impact in the country’s population, which will ultimately present a threat to the stability and security of the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD. Democracy and Federalism<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD.1 NCP feud: Factional politics is on the rise in NCP party and hindered the merger which eventually shall hit the long awaited political stability in the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNine senior leaders are protecting their group interests in the party. PM Oli leads a group with committed members and has home minister Ram Bahadur Thapa as the new comer.[63]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring an event organized to commemorate the death of former communist leader Madan Bhandari, Pushpa Kamal Dahal indicated he had been assassinated by foreign forces. Dahal implied he was under a similar threat.[64]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the event, Dahal also said there would be no power transfer outside NCP. “NC should not dream that NCP will split and it will get a chance,” he said adding that NCP’s failure would tantamount to the nation’s failure. He implied that any tussle for power was internal.[65]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNCP discussed the name of in-charge and co-in-charge of the district committee. The party formed central, provincial, and relation coordination committee, sister wings of Madhes Committee and also formed international coordination committee.[66]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe party is yet to finalize the head of the party organization department. Both co-chairs want their person as head of the department. Leader Bamdev Gautam is the top contender for the post.[67]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal claimed that he will be the next prime minister on the basis of 5-point agreement in between him and PM Oli.[68] Both Chairs met to discuss the power-sharing issue after the agreement surfaced on social media.[69]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSenior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, claiming ignorance of the agreement, urged that the government should operate for five years. [70]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA meeting of the central secretariat of NCP on June 4 ended inconclusively. The meeting held to finalize the work division of central committee members, chose the head of various party departments as well as full-size and division of politburo members.[71] The issue of contention was one leader one responsibility rule or otherwise.[72]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDistrict committees are gradually taking full shape. Morang formed its district committee with 185 members led by Rishikesh Pokharel (former UML) and Secretary Ganesh Upreti from erstwhile Maoist Center.[73]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRift in the party was a reason behind the government’s announcement that Kathmandu will not be hosting the 2019 International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards. The decision did not come in response to resounding public and political discontent. Instead, the IIFA awards became a pawn in the ongoing power struggle within the ruling party. As such is the case, the rift among leaders will affect all government actions not only the ones not in the interest of the country, but all those which are in the interest of the country too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD.2 Opposition Parties: Nepali congress, the key opposition is weakening further waning hope of the people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepali Congress seems to be weakening further with politics of faction, sub-factions, and groups as seen in the ongoing nationwide awareness programme.[74]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNC President Sher Bahadur Deuba claimed that NC will start a movement to uproot the Communist as it did with the Ranas, the Panchayat, and the Monarchy.[75]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNC registered a public importance proposal at the federal parliament over labour agreement with Malaysia and the subsequent withholding of employment migration.[76]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSamajbadi Party Nepal, which was seen as an alternative is breaking when it was just starting to build. The party has been using tools of threat against the government, but in vain. v Samajbadi Party Nepal co-chairs Baburam Bhattarai and Upendra Yadav charged the government of seriously not considering amendment in the constitution as per their demands. The party indicated at withdrawal from the government and going for street protests against the government.[77]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe party also criticized the Public Service Commission on its recent recruitment announcement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRJP-N and Samajbadi Party Nepal, leaders, Rajendra Mahato and Upendra Yadav discussed reshuffling Province 2 government. Despite ongoing discussion, RJP-N is yet not ready to join the Samajbadi party.[78] Both parties have claimed that a new alternative force should replace the traditional parties and informally discuss party merger. [79]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRJP-N also started talks with various ethnic parties for revival of identity movement. The party leaders discussed with Tarai Tharuhat party and Kumar Lingden-led Limbuwan Party. [80]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith all the developments going on the fringe parties around mergers and getting stronger, there is a chance of strong alternative political force rising in Nepal’s political domain. Samajbadi-RJP-N is making a bid towards that end. However, there is a decision awaited from the parties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFringe parties continue to carry out activities to show their presence in support of agenda of restoration of Hinduism while some have reckoning a need of merger amongst themselves and making their presence felt.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChairman of Rastriya Prajatantra Party-United, Pashupati Sumsher JBR Rana said that they will take to street movement for restoration of Hindu state. He claimed that as 81% Nepalis are Hindu and 94% belong to Omkar family, the restoration is possible without foreign support.[81] Similarly, Kamal Thapa of Rastriya Prajatantra Party announced the start of second Rashtriya Swabhiman Abhiyan from Mustang. Thapa also called for roundtable conference accommodating the former king and Biplab for ensuring peace and political stability. [82]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD. 3 Budget and Economy: The rampant anomalies towards the end of the fiscal year remained characteristic of Nepal’s budget expenditure system this fiscal year as well. The expenditure on facilities including vehicles for officials topped the expenditure list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKarnali Pradesh took a controversial decision of purchasing 54 four wheelers by allocating a budget of over Rs. two billion from the development budget. The government already bought 42 four wheelers and plans to buy 12 more. The government will also purchase 10 ambulances at a cost of Rs 150 million.[83]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ministry of Women, Children, and Senior Citizens started the President Women Uplift Program in 30 districts from current fiscal year 2018/19. Minister for Women, Children, and Senior Citizens, Tham Maya Thapa said that grant amounting to Rs 305.5 million has been provided to 47 groups and organizations run by women in order to assist them in operating agriculture, tourism, livestock, and skilled–based enterprises. The minister also informed that the program will be expanded to 55 districts in the upcoming fiscal year.[84]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocal women from Mahakali Municipality are working on a construction of Mahakali River embankment for the past three months. The construction work is commissioned mostly to women to make them economically strong and not to seek monetary support from their family.[85]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter unveiling its budget, Province 2 brought forward the idea of developing cultural cities. The government also announced development of Madhes-Mithila Artist Center and including Mithila Art in school textbooks.[86]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) disrupted provincial assembly meeting of Province 3 claiming that the budget announced for 2019-20 was distributive and not inclusive.[87]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe provinces in their budget have prioritized agriculture, physical infrastructure, education, and tourism sectors and industrial sectors.[88] A campaign ‘Healthy Life Programme’ aimed at enhancing access to health facilities has been introduced in Province 1.[89]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite announcement of a few new initiatives, the budget followed the same old trend of being distributive rather than focusing on something substantial in line with the government’s ‘Prosperous Nepal-Happy Nepali’ agenda. The expenditure trend, towards the end of the fiscal and around monsoon season, remains a challenge. The government needs to break the trend and implement projects timely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD. 4 Civic Space and Human Rights: Following criticism, the government dropped the Guthi Bill from the National Assembly. This put the government at a tight spot with regards to many other contested bills, including the Media Council Bill. Civil society, journalists, and opposition parties have also demanded withdrawal of the controversial NHRC Act. The past decisions of the government remains futile in human rights in the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFarmers who were unable to pay back the loans of the landlords were mired into the never-ending circle of bonded laborers, fell into the category of Haliyas and Kamaiyas. This was in practice in the far west region of Nepal. [90] This system was abolished on paper, though there are few who still practice it. In order to uphold the rights of Haliyas, the government provided financial support to provide them with pieces of land. However, some families are surviving in poverty with the land gone, while some are back to the same practice again. In Jajarkot only, 202 Dalit Haliyas are still landless. Their life has not changed, and they still depend on labor.[91] In the last fiscal year, Rs. 3.89 billion budget was set aside to complete the rehabilitation work for Kamaiyas and Haliyas.[92]However, it needs comprehensive empowerment package, including re-establishment amenities so that they don’t have to go back to the practice again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmidst criticism, Bhanu Bhakta Dhakal, Minister of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs claimed that the government brought the NHRC Bill as per Nepal’s Constitution.[93] However, opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba accused the government of being authoritarian and undermining democracy. Deuba claimed that as the people dismissed Rana rule and Monarchy, and this government will have the same fate if it goes against the democratic system, curtail civil liberties, freedom of expression, and intervene in the NHRC.[94]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFNJ, in its third phase of protest campaign, collected signatures of 20,000 journalist and forwarded it to the PM office through respective chief district officers of 77 districts.[95]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD.5 Judiciary/Corruption: In the recent months, stories of increasing corruption, distortion, and various other malpractices in the judiciary became quite regular.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdvocate Narayan Prasad Duwadi, chairman, Independent National Law Professionals Campaign demanded screening of academic certificates of all judges and justices.[96] The CIAA has been refusing to provide the Supreme Court with the case files and the decision to prosecute former minister Gobinda Raj Joshi since the last five years. In its latest decision, the Supreme Court has asked the CIAA to submit the decision and case files within 15 days.[97]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD.6 Good Governance: The government transferred more than Rs 5 billion under budget heads at the end of the current fiscal year. The government made the transfer to pay motivational allowances to government officials and overtime wages to customs officials. Almost every year, the finance ministry allows large budget transfer in headings at the end of the fiscal year. The government also spent a huge sum to fund official visits to foreign countries this year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government recommended four names as possible ambassadors – Mahesh Dahal for Australia, Narad Bhardwaj Wagle for Qatar, Banshi Dhar Mishra for Bangladesh, and Dawa Futi Sherpa for Spain.[98]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe incumbent government defied the criteria of diplomatic experiences and credentials in nominating the Ambassadors. The cabinet decision went against foreign ministry’s new criteria for selection of ambassador.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671343700_oli-dahal-100x56.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-06', '2019-10-16', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 17:53:20', '2022-12-18 17:53:46');

The possibility of political and social stability depends on many factors including the relations between the state, political elites, and the ordinary citizens. In particular, a political system remains stable as long as the political elites do not have an incentive to undermine the system. Democratic stability in Nepal also depends on other external factors like the strength of the civil society, the characteristics of democratic state institutions, potential economic and political crises, economic inequality, and geopolitics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncidents and episodes in the past few months, however, reveal contradictions in the processes of economic development and democratization in Nepal, raising questions about the country’s long-term social stability. Although political elites abide by democratic practice in broader terms—taking part in elections and constitutional processes—they resist democracy in practice while running political parties, legislating policies, or governing. The actual level of democracy, in practice, is determined by the level of concessions the elites are willing to make.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA power struggle is brewing between PM KP Oli and co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda. The struggle is spilling over into other sectors including political economy, international relations, and alliance with emerging political movement around the Hindu religion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s international relations revolves mostly around its two giant neighbors – India and China – and lately the US. As a geopolitical need, China and India will have higher engagement with Nepal than any other countries, and the US, as a global superpower, remains engaged in the region to have a closer look at China. The competitive engagement of these countries, at times, have pressurized Nepal to choose sides, which could have been easily solved via diplomatic maturity from the leaders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current government’s lack of clarity regarding relation with both India and China have made both the countries distrust Nepal. This will affect Nepal’s potentials and opportunities for further development. Nepal’s public perception has played a huge part while getting involved with both its giant neighbors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn many occasions, the Prime Minister shamelessly accepted that he was either uninformed, misguided, or cheated by top bureaucrats and key officials on various issues and had to publicly apologize on the vegetables and fru its import row, to name one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ruling party leaders remain divided internally in the power bargain. PM Oli is seen gradually weakening while co-chair Dahal is slowly gaining power. Factions of Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal together have a grip over party’s decisions.[1] PM Oli has faced widespread criticism, both in terms of government’s performance and autocratic leadership in the party.[2] The Prime Minister seems to have made a realization and is on the path to regaining power in the party. The appointment of Yogesh Bhattarai from Madhav Nepal camp as Minister for Tourism is said to signal the resurrection to power.[3]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInternal Political Settlement<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe NCP merger process has faced jolts for the last one and a half year. The merger, nearing towards completion, is stuck on a squabble over leadership of the party’s school department. The process is stalled for weeks as both party chairs will be abroad. The erstwhile Maoist and UML want the lead for their own candidates Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Ishwor Pokharel respectively.[4]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs all the positions in the party were allocated on a sharing basis, factional politics remains alive.[5] Five leaders claimed the leadership of the school department, and the inability of the party in deciding it has delayed the unification process.[6] Besides Pokharel and Shrestha, Ghanshyam Bhusal,[7] Beduram Bhusal, and Jhalanath Khanal claimed the leadership.[8]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe senior leaders are too engaged in power bargaining and have failed to look into other matters of national importance. Top leaders are competing to gain their grip in the party. After the sharing, the equation is heavier on the former UML side as Madhav Kumar Nepal is getting more shares in the bargain. Leaders of Nepal camp took leadership of 19 district in-charges whereas Prachanda camp bagged 29 and PM Oli faction leaders 23.[9] Prachanda will eventually have a tough time leading the party in the future as there will be a lot of internal tussles coming up.[10]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecent political changes in Nepal have favored one group of political elites including a chunk of former Maoist leaders while marginalizing others, including a group that was once close to the monarchy. Within the ruling party, there is a clear schism between the former Maoists and the former UML. Episodes in July show that the struggle for power between PM K P Oli and co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal is spilling over into other sectors including political economy, international relations, and alliance with political elites excluded from the recent political settlements.[11] The merger between the two parties was the most significant factor leading to a near-absolute majority for the Nepal Communist Party, which was forged after the elections. As Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda has indicated several times in the past month, the partnership that propelled K P Oli to power can still be reversed or redirected if his incentives and interests are not fulfilled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe opposition, Nepali Congress, is also facing difficulties in internal political settlements in the face of an upcoming general convention. Leaders have argued that holding a general convention was the only way of restoring NC image. NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba is facing fierce pressure from party leaders to hold the 14th general convention of the party, but some are lobbying for his one-year extension. The party statue allows extension of one-year tenure of party president under special circumstances.[12] On July 7, at the central working committee meeting, Deuba refused the proposal of holding the general convention.[13] The party, however, unanimously endorsed the party regulation, 2076[14] amidst criticism that the new regulation would convert the mass-based party to a cadre-based party and affect democracy.[15]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Samajbadi Party, formed after the merger of Sangiya Samajbadi Party and Naya Shakti Party, is planning to pull out of the government if the Oli government does not amend the constitution. The Samajbadi Party is also talking with Rashtriya Janata Party-Nepal (RJP-N), who is also demanding an amendment to the Constitution. The RJP-N withdrew its support from the government in March.[16]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContradictions in the Political Economy<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout most of Nepal’s modern history, the state and the ruling regime used the means of violence available to them to extract wealth from the people and the country rather than creating wealth and protecting private property. This characteristics of the ruling regime and the state, which prevented the country from developing in the past, has not changed even now. While the government’s efforts at economic development are facing critical hurdles, political elites are fighting over the mechanisms to extract wealth. Given the role of high-stakes players, the government is finding it difficult to impose rule of law in the market, especially for big businesses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, Nepal’s macroeconomic outlook holds a lot of promise, with the prospects of growth in the service, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors despite a contraction in public investment.[17] Nepal’s economic prospects depend on international job markets for Nepali migrants, tourist arrivals, infrastructure development, and structural reforms. There are, however, significant risks and challenges, driven primarily by corruption, climate-related disasters, inequality, uncertainty of remittance flows, and problems in the labor market.[18] Events and episodes in July revealed some of these risks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Nepal’s labor policy regarding Malaysia is failing,[19] the labor market in the six Gulf countries is shrinking—the number of youth going to these countries shrunk by 17% last year. Similarly, Nepal has an opportunity to take advantage of the demographic dividend window—a period where the workforce is increasing at a greater rate than those who depend on it—but experts and reports indicate that Nepal is unable to generate employment for them.[20]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, the infrastructure development process, touted as one of the paths to economic development and prosperity, is faltering. Currently, more than 2500 infrastructure projects are facing delays.[21] About 50% of these projects are roads and bridges. One of the reasons cited for such a state of affairs was lack of preparation on the part of the ministries. Similarly, there were problems related to acquisition of land and forest clearance, which affected the USD 180-million Kusma-Butwal transmission line under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Power System Expansion Project.[22] The Gautam Buddha Airport in Bhairahawa, which is being constructed by a Chinese Company—Northwest Civil Aviation Airport Construction Company—was supposed to be completed by December 2017, but has been delayed until December 2019.[23] Nepal and India have hit a snag for the extension of the Butwal-Gorkhapur transmission line[24] and energy banking system[25] although Nepal started exporting electricity to India from July.[26] To add to the woes, the Asian Development Bank refused to finance USD 250 million for the second phase of the Melamchi project until the project delivers drinking water to Kathmandu.[27]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile government expenditure is ad hoc and mismanaged—more than Rs 256 billion was spent in the last month of the fiscal year—the revenue collection decreased by 12%.[28] Unease is growing over the burgeoning trade deficit and the dwindling foreign currency reserve[29] which is having a direct impact on government’s revenue targets. Nepal Rastra Bank issued a report in July showing that Nepal’s balance of payments deficit was Rs 90 billion in the first 11 months of fiscal year 2018-19, cushioned by an increasing remittance which amounted to Rs 799 billion in the same period.[30] Nepal depends on imports to meet its revenue targets. Nepal’s main southern ports like Birganj and Biratnagar have been unable to meet revenue collection targets due to dwindling imports, Nepal’s northern port, Timure port in Rasuwa, has exceeded the targets. Imports from the Timure transit have more than doubled in the last year to Rs 43.24 billion while export from the port has dropped 25% to Rs 1.16 billion.[31] According to the Finance Minister, about half of Nepal’s economy is informal and grey and operating outside of rule of law.[32]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tourism sector has the potential to offer respite, however, Nepal’s tourism promotion effort for the Visit Nepal 2020 program and the national air carrier have both failed to deliver. Nepal’s tourism promotion initiative, led by a businessman close to PM Oli, has done little to promote Nepal abroad,[33] and Nepal Airlines is suffering heavy losses compounded by the failure to ensure destinations in China. An air service agreement revised in July allows China to operate 98 flights per week (from the earlier 70) to Nepal, while Nepal Airlines continues to face hurdles to fly to even a single destination in China.[34] Nepal Airlines has been seeking permits to fly to China for several years now but has not succeeded. Given the situation, Chinese airlines will be the sole beneficiaries of tourist arrivals in Nepal during the Visit Nepal Year 2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Nepal Airlines Corporation has been unable to recoup money from its investment in Chinese airplanes and the two wide-body Airbus 330s. For a long time, PM Oli’s business aide with significant stakes in the tourism sector, Ang Tshering Sherpa, was overseeing the sector and is believed to have orchestrated the purchase of the Airbus aircraft. After Sherpa’s death and his reputation at stake, PM Oli is directly looking into the affairs of the national flag carrier. He held a meeting with top officials in July. During the meeting, officials briefed the PM that Nepal Airlines had accumulated more than Rs 40 billion in debt, while losses had crossed Rs 5 billion.[35] Nepal Airlines has 13 airplanes, however, only seven of them are flying at the moment, with all the Chinese airplanes grounded.[36] The Nepal Airlines is making preparation to fly some of them during the coming festive season and has refused to pay the final installment of the loan to Exim Bank, given several critical problems that have plagued the airplanes, including their technical capacity, excessive insurance fees, non-availability of spare parts, and excessive maintenance costs.[37]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout access to long-haul routes in Europe and Asia, the NAC will continue to pile losses.[38] NAC’s new flight route to Osaka is struggling to get passengers.[39] Since removing Nepal from Europe’s blacklist is a priority, the government is preparing to amend the Civil Aviation Bill to restructure the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN).[40] Himalaya Airlines, patronized by PM Oli and partly-owned by Sherpa’s family, is now planning to fly to Beijing.[41] Once it gets the slot to Beijing, the airline will have to acquire a long-haul aircraft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDistributive Tendencies<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the absence of strong labor movements, left ideology is no longer sufficient for re-election, and the political party would have to deliver macro-economic results, including redistribution of wealth, that are more favorable to the poor and the intermediate classes. Re-election depends on the votes of the ordinary people, support of intermediate classes (clients), financial resources, and, in the case of individual leaders, leverages of external actors to maintain a hold in the party. Votes of the ordinary people depend on both the delivery of economic outcomes as well as the parties’ capacity to represent or coopt emotionally charged populist agenda. As of now, the focus is not so much on the elections and popular support, as the next round of elections are still three years away. The focus is more on building relations with political elites, ensuring access to resources, and maintaining relations with foreign powers who have leverage on domestic political balance of power. The power of left ideology solely exists as redistributionand this year’s budget continues that trend. In Nepal, welfare helps social control of the women and elderly, while the youth go abroad for employment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government is turning into a distributive coalition with excessive and wasteful spending. The main opposition Nepali Congress has remarked that budgets presented by provincial governments were distributive in nature and gave continuity to programs and policies of the past year.[42] Earlier, critics claimed that the budget of the federal government did not address the economic reality of the country. Amidst depleting financial resources the country plans to make a lot of borrowings to pay for the increased salary of government employees. The government with a supermajority has not made any attempt towards increasing productivity and imports.[43]Ironically, trade deficit has ballooned and outflow of money surpassed the inflow by Rs 90.83 billion in the first 11 months of the past fiscal year, an increment of 17.2% for the same period in the previous year.[44]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe budget for the fiscal year failed to include any such programs in support of the policy and programs presented on May 21, which claimed that the government will adopt a policy to not import goods and services that make adverse impact on people’s health, promote unnecessary consumption, and damage domestic industries.[45] The state coffers will be exhausted on populist programs such as the constituency development program.[46] The provinces have followed the same in their budget announcement. The provincial lawmakers have been allocated as much as 9% of the total budget of the provinces.[47] The NCP government has failed to deliver on the agenda of prosperity.[48] The budget, unfortunately, a populist one,[49] has no hopes for economic transformation of the country. Most recently, the government has been giving away construction contracts to erstwhile Maoist-affiliated contractors without following public procurement procedures.[50] The cabinet, in its recent decision, approved a contract amounting Rs 43 crores without any competitive bidding.[51]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll three levels of the government have been unable to spend the budget properly, raising questions about fiscal discipline and corruption. There has been no paradigm shift in the budget expenditure pattern despite the change in the political system of the country. Despite a two-third majority government, budget spending situation is weak in all provincial governments. Thus, at the end of fiscal year 2018/19, the government was able to spend only half of the current budget. The budget utilization situation shows that the process has not taken any momentum. It remains the same – traditional, sluggish, and stagnant with recurrent expenses and nearly half of the capital budget unspent. The provinces followed the same path as the federal government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven after federalization, out of seven provinces, Province 2, Province 3, and Gandaki Pradesh did not perform well in terms of budget expenditure. Province 2 spent only half of the budget while the remaining budget was frozen. The province government claimed that the government could not utilize the budget sufficiently due to lack of employees.[52] A lot of expenditure seems to have gone in unproductive sectors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe federal government is taking initiatives to enhance the capacity of the provinces and local governments, but at the same time, it is refusing to delegate authority and is trying to maintain control of provincial security. Provinces have opposed bills interrelated with federal, provincial, and local levels as there are provisions which allow the federal government to direct the provincial and local governments.[53]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProvince 2 sued the federal government against the June 6 decision that authorized the merger of Sagarnath Forestry Development Project with Forest Corporation, a federal government entity.[54] National forests are under provincial government’s jurisdiction, but laws and national policies, including parks and reserves, fall under the federal government. Forests are also on concurrent lists and hence requires a clearly defined jurisdi ction of the three tiers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConflict over ownership and extraction of natural resources will be increasing in the days to come. The constitution has elaborated on the single rights and concurrent rights of the three tiers of the governments. However, further elaboration on various issues, especially taxation and natural resources ownership, seems an immediate requirement to do away with the emerging conflicts over ownership and sharing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPopulism and its Response<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGlobally, as neoliberalism has failed to address issues of social inequality and economic insecurity, the left ideology has failed to become relevant while the populist right has stepped up, in most instances by projecting blame on “others” including the minorities, liberals, and immigrants.[55] While the middle ground erodes, extreme leftists and fascists are also gaining ground. Populism feeds off resentment. As in the rest of the world,[56] populism in Nepal is also weakening core democratic values and institutions like the freedom of association, free speech, an independent civil society, and core state legal institutions. Under pressure, the Nepali Congress is being forced to shed much of its liberal values and shift towards populist rhetoric.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ruling regime appears to be moving closer to emerging movements and leaders engaged in identity politics through a discourse of nationalism and religious identity. Amid reports that PM KP Oli appeared to be growing closer to the Hindu movement and monarchists, Dahal and the Maoists responded by saying that they could oust Gyanendra from his Nagarjun residence if he continued to poke his nose in politics.[57]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rise of the conservatism is not because of the political parties or charismatic leaders; a conservative civil society has the ability to shape political events, and in most cases, it is the ordinary people who are driving the conservative wave.[58] In Nepal’s case, nationalism and ethnic conflict have emerged as a response to insecurity by both the elites and the traditionally dominant groups. There is a need to track social movements at the level of civil society and where it is heading. At present, there is a continued undercurrent of Hindu religious movements, which fear the rise of Christianity; a growing anti-corruption movement, which is likely to grow stronger and generate antipathy towards the corrupt elite; and a nationalist movement around the idea of sovereignty with strong anti-India, anti-Madhes bias.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInternational Relations and Foreign Policy<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany people are criticizing the Oli government for lacking clarity and consistency in its international relations, losing trust with some of its key partners, including China and the US. Nepal has had to issue diplomatic clarifications on its position on more than three occasions to India and the US, all of them a major embarrassment to the government.[59] On many occasions, the diplomatic episodes indicated a lack of coordination and communication at the highest levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile China is pushing its interests, as reflected through the joint border control mechanism and air services agreement, Nepal has failed to gain from bilateral relations. Nepal signed a three-year BRI framework agreement with China in May 2017. Some 26 months from the agreement, Nepal has been unable to pursue any of the nine projects that it had identified, other than conducting a pre-feasibility project for the Kerung-Kathmandu railway.[60] Government spokesperson, Gokul Baskota admitted that Nepal was still not clear about which projects to pursue under BRI. Nepal and China continue to pursue new agreements and projects, without ensuring smooth implementation of past agreements and projects. Rasuwa immigration office has issued more than 10,000 cards to travelers visiting Kerung in the past four years. The number of people entering Nepal from the other side is much higher, with 14,000 Chinese entering Nepal in the past fiscal year alone.[61]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina, meanwhile, further increased the number of flights to Nepal, pushed for a joint border command and control mechanism, and facilitated the entry of new companies. After sustained pressure from China, Nepal has finally consented to a joint command and control mechanism to manage its northern border. Such a mechanism was one of the preconditions for the opening of the Zham-Tatopani transit point.[62] The border finally opened four years after the earthquake, but China is yet to allow free movement of people and goods.[63] China’s UnionPay entered Nepal after receiving permission from the regulatory bodies. Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, congratulated UnionPay and encouraged Chinese business in Nepal to comply with the law of the land.[64] China has started engaging with central, provincial, and local governments, and the general public as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s Home Ministry stopped the celebration of the Dalai Lama’s 84th birthday on July 6th. District Administration Office, Kathmandu, rejected a request from the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office to organize a celebration citing that no anti-China activities would be allowed on Nepali soil.[65] As the Dalai Lama celebrated his birthday, the succession question has propelled a debate. A Chinese official and a member of a Beijing-based think tank told some visiting Indian journalists that China will reject any Dalai Lama that is born outside its territory and among the Tibetans-in-Exile.[66] The comment sparked widespread condemnation from the international community and from the Central Tibetan Administration. Chinese authority has well understood that in order to be able to ‘Sinocise’ the Tibetan community they must earn legitimacy first, which could only come if they could control the next spiritual leader.[67] The Third Tibet Work Forum was the landmark strategic forum after which China’s State Administration for Religious Affairs issued its State Religious Affairs Bureau Order no-5[68] which made the Chinese stamp of approval non-negotiable in order to choose a reincarnate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJournalists in Nepal are discouraged from covering Tibetan affairs and government officials shy away from commenting on China-related issues. With the increasing foray of Chinese investment in Nepal’s economy, it seems as though the media is expected to be muzzled and must not offend the Chinese narrative. Furthermore, this censorship is not restricted to the media itself, as Pradip Yadav of the Samajbadi Party of Nepal was suspended for six months for taking part in a Free Tibet related program in Latvia.[69]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe constitution of Nepal does not allow local governments to sign contracts with foreign companies on leasing lands. An agreement of leasing nearly 353 acres of land, signed between Mahottari local government and a Chinese agrotech company past January to build a hi-tech industrial park, was annulled by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies. It has now been reported that the same project is being taken forward by the federal government.[70] It is not clear whether the project will materialize or not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina’s security concern in relation to the Tibetan Autonomous Region has been a top agenda for Chinese engagement in Nepal. Other forms of engagement in Nepal-China relations remain secondary. The impending battle to choose the next Dalai Lama will put Nepali Buddhism followers as well as the ones in engaged and the government will have to respond to it in line with the policy as well as universal humanitarian principles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForeign Minister Gyawali held a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to explore the possibility of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal.[71] Government sources confirmed that China’s President Xi Jinping will be visiting Nepal. The announcement will be made after the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Nepal.[72]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nForeign Ministry Directive<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the status of federalism in Nepal is still questionable, the new directives on foreign contacts have made the country’s engagements federal government-controlled. The directives have restricted provincial and local governments not reach an agreement with international bodies, without the consent of MoFA. The document even says that if any officials wish to visit foreign countries, the parties should write to MoFA and present a report after returning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe move made by the federal government comes with a surprising fact that, although MoFA officials have been frequently holding meetings with Chinese and making statements supporting China, the directives published limits Nepal and China’s engagements. The document even says not to reach an agreement to build any sister relation, without informing the ministry. This particular directive is solely targeting China, as provinces have been recently establishing sisterly relation with provinces in China. Province 5 Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel and his team visited Chengdu in China on the invitation of International Department of Communist Party of China to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on establishing sisterly relations between the Sichuan Province of China and Province 5.[73] Province 3 Chief Minister Dormani Poudel participated at Lanzhou Investment and Trade Fair and High-End Forum on Silk Road cooperation program’ in Gansu province and the two provinces have also established sister relations.[74]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal-India<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s relation with India has not improved. The negative sentiments of the public toward India pushed Nepali leaders to withdraw the government’s decision of host IIFA. India’s Prime Minister Modi will study the EPG report, which has been stalled for many years.[75] In addition, the pesticide row between Nepal and India brought out pseudo-nationalism in Nepal[76] and created a negative image of India once again. Nepal stopped the import of fruits and vegetables from India citing high levels of pesticide residue, and the Indian Embassy sent a letter asking for reasons of the stoppage. The government, instead of acknowledging it as a health hazard, publicized the letter from the Embassy. Nepal cannot import anything without testing for pesticide residue, but the country does not have laboratories or testing facilities to check it. All of this was perceived as a response to the letter from Indian Embassy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this issue, Nepal should not be expecting relations of equals with India, but it has the rights to standardize the quality of the imports and reject the ones not meeting it. There should be a system and process in place before deciding on an ad hoc basis and causing international shame and revoking decisions. Nepal has been notorious at revoking decisions at home and it has been a culture in internal affairs; it can be said that the culture has been transmitted in international relations as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA talk program on ‘Nepal-India Relations: Development and Dynamics’ was held between the officials of Nepal and India on July 18. The discussion was held to forward land connectivity between the two countries and to overcome the barriers for an emerging economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinister for Commerce, Matrika Yadav, and India’s Ambassador to Nepal Manjeev Singh Puri jointly inspected the cross border petroleum pipeline.[77] The 69-km pipeline was completed 15 months prior to the deadline. PM Modi along with PM Oli is expected to inaugurate the project soon. The cost of the pipeline is about Rs 350 crore and is entirely invested by Indian Oil Corporation.[78]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNewly appointed chief of India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Samant Goel met with top political leaders and high-ranking security officials during his short visit.[79] The visit drew attention as his meetings with leaders were kept secret. Goel had a one-on-one meeting with NCP co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal at his house in Khumaltar.[80] However, Goel met with PM Oli along with his advisors and party secretary Bishnu Poudel. PM Oli wanted to talk with RAW chief alone, but it did not happen. Oli only had a few minutes in private with Goel.[81] Despite media claims that Goel also met leaders of Nepali Congress and Madhes-centric Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal, Congress spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma and RJPN’s Raj Kishore Yadav claimed that they were unaware of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia submitted the final DPR for 18.5-km cross border railway between Nepal and India to the railway department. The railway line connects Rupaidiya of India with Kohalpur of Nepal and will run parallel with the East-West Highway and Postal Highway.[82]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal developed closer infrastructure integration with India after the completion of an oil pipeline[83] and growing use of the Visakhapatnam port.[84] However, the media reported that these developments could make Nepal more dependent on India.[85]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecurity and Strategic Affairs<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe outlawed CPN (Biplab) party is escalating the violent activities as there has been no formal dialogue with the government yet. The government continues its forceful action against the outlawed party. The party continues its donation drives and violent activities including destroying telecommunication towers across the country. Although the outlawed party does not have a defined cause to generate public support for armed aggression, the government should opt for a negotiated settlement and see an end to violence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the last five months, since the ban on the party, police arrested 606 cadres. At least nine cadres have been killed, including six in bomb explosions.[86] Som Prasad Pandey, the coordinator of the government talk team, confirmed that no formal talks have taken place with the outlawed party yet.[87] Gokul Baskota, spokesman and Minister of Communication and Information Technology, accused NC of supporting the outfit.[88] In a recent incident, Biplab cadre Nir Kumar Rai was killed in police action in Bhojpur. Police constable Sanjiv Rai also lost his life in the shootout.[89] Three cadres of the party have been killed in police action since the party was outlawed.[90]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe party announced a general strike on July 31 against the arrest of Maila Lama, who is the central committee leader and Kathmandu district in-charge of the party.[91]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinister of Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa stated that the outlawed party is a hazard to peace and security of the country. He claimed that informal talks were underway to mainstream the outlawed party.[92]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGender, Inclusion, and Human Rights<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMigration: Travel ban on women for abroad employment is against constitutional rights. Despite being discriminatory, the government, however, has said the ban is to safeguard women against exploitation in Gulf countries, where they normally go to work as domestic help. The travel ban has limited their access to legal remedy in case of abuse and exploitation. Further, women, who left the country, before the ban was imposed, have not yet returned as they fear that they would not be able to go back to work again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe travel ban has done more damage than good, as it has given a huge impetus to trafficking and has made the women more vulnerable than ever. Their passports are confiscated by their owners, and they are kept as bonded laborers. There is no legal remedy as they become undocumented migrants. Women, who fall prey to trafficking, lose both ways – they are deceived in their own country by the traffickers and are exploited abroad as they don’t have access to resources and lack administrative and legal knowledge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThree Nepali women who had reached Malawi, Southeast African country to work as domestic maids, through a network of human traffickers, have not been rescued since the last seven months. The rescue operation has become complicated because Nepal has no diplomatic relations with Malawi. South Africa based Nepali Commissioner didn’t pay much concern to their pleas. A Nepali based in Malawi informed that the women didn’t have necessary documents and visa, and they have escaped from a safe house.[93] Their current status is unknown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWomen migrants choose to work as domestic help because it doesn’t need much educational qualification and training. They choose to migrate hoping to elevate their socio-economic status in the society despite the risks associated with it. The government has failed to create a safe and dignified working environment abroad for women and instead has implemented a ban, which restricts women’s mobility and freedom to work. And, this has resulted in more cases of human trafficking as women become vulnerable at a higher degree.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, Nepal is missing an opportunity of taking advantage of the demographic advantage as 40% of the population are in the active age of 16-40. Failing to mobilize its human resource and skills in the country has hit the country. Amidst huge unemployment rates and the lack of opportunities at home, thousands migrate abroad for work.[94]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, economic logic has remained supreme despite the social costs of family separation, break ups, increased extra-marital affairs, inflicted suicides, and murders. Having opportunities at home for livelihood would have made migration a secondary choice to make a living, propelling the country’s economy not remittance-dependent but production-driven.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMonsoon Maladies: The ruling and opposition parties criticized and accused each other in the parliament on relief and rescue work in the flood-affected areas. NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba proposed a diplomatic solution with India on the issue of Koshi barrage, while the ruling lawmakers have defended the government claiming that the floods were caused due to Nepal’s fault.[95]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRajendra Mahato expressed the need for banning excessive extraction of Chure range to prevent Madhesh from natural disasters. He suggested Government of India and Nepal find a joint solution and accused the government of neglecting it, causing the Madhes to flood every year.[96]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Emergency Operation Centre reported that 111 people across the country were killed during the recent flood havoc. A total of 128 incidents of floods and 208 events of landslides were recorded this monsoon.[97]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEuropean Union announced a grant of Euro 8.5 million in South and South-East Asian countries affected by flood and landslide. It is stated that Euro 1.5 million will be provided to the victims of ongoing monsoon in India and Bangladesh as humanitarian funding package and rest to Nepal and the Philippines.[98]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncomplete construction projects took the lives of 25 children. The children were trapped and drowned in the trenches dug and abandoned during various construction projects. The trenches got waterlogged during the monsoon and the children were unable to come out from them.[99]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe loss and the damages that the flood inflicts every year is too high. Nepali media reported that the dams constructed by India caused the bordering villages in Nepal to inundate.[100] This has caused strain in Nepal-India relations. Even though it has been a perennial problem, every ruling government has failed to find solutions. Despite some steps from Nepal, the Indian government has not shown much interest.[101] It is time that the government established an autonomous authority to look into disaster and implement a permanent solution and assure a safe future for the people across Terai who live in disaster-prone areas.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671344193_rupani-nursery-planting-saplings-daily-work14-1-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-07', '2019-10-17', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:01:33', '2022-12-18 18:01:33');

The Preamble of the Constitution of Nepal strives for economic equality, prosperity, and social justice by eradicating discrimination based on class, caste, region, language, religion, and gender.[1] It also states ‘it stands against all forms of discrimination and oppression created by the feudalistic, autocratic, centralised, unitary system of governance’. The Constitution has guaranteed various constitutional rights that address gender inequality such as Article 18.[2] Article 38(5) further has provisions for positive discrimination towards women and ensures special opportunity for women in education, health, employment, and social security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also ensures that no woman shall be subjected to physical, mental, sexual, psychological, or other forms of violence or exploitation on grounds of religion, social, cultural tradition, practice or on any other grounds. This, in essence, works towards achieving substantive gender equality and incorporates not just the availability of opportunities to all but also to establish equality in outcomes. Gender-based violence (GBV) against women has been a major social problem reported both in the rural and the urban Nepal, which reflects the power structure that perforates gender equality in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bhagrathi Rape Case</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the country was still reeling from the devastating incidents of Nirmala Panta’s and Samjhana BK’s rape and murder cases, yet again it was hit by another similar case of rape and murder of Bhagrathi Bhatta. On February 3, the 17-year-old was raped and murdered brutally in Baitadi. Her body was recovered from the Tawalek Community Forest on February 4. The alarming incident ignited a public outrage. The government is notorious for turning a blind eye to crimes against women as the response in previous cases showed. There was a fear instilled in public that this particular case would also be left unresolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, in this case, the police carried out the investigation diligently and was able to arrest the alleged perpetrator on February 16. As per the alleged perpetrator’s confession, the crime was committed as an act of vengeance. Men’s masculinity has always been intrinsically tied to women’s bodies. A woman’s body is considered to be an embodiment of honour and hence, something that can be robbed. Customarily, women’s bodies have been treated as a moral compass. Thus, in a highly entrenched patriarchal society, women are subjected to disgraceful punishment for offenses they have not committed, and rape is being used as an instrument to establish male dominance over a women’s body and in society, in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stringent Immigration Rule</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On February 10, Department of Immigration recommended a proposal to the Home Ministry to bring about amendment to the visit visa provisions under the Immigration Procedure, 2065. The amendment proposal stipulated that women below the age of 40 would mandatorily require obtaining permit letters from father, husband, or son, as well as the ward to independently travel abroad under this visit visa. The particular amendment suggested a blanket ban on women travelling abroad. This led to massive public uproar, after which the proposal was amended and changed to ‘women under age of 40 travelling to Gulf and African regions.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Director of Immigration, such draconian rule was formulated to curb women trafficking. Over the past 30 years, the Government of Nepal has adopted different policies which have resulted in restricting women’s free, unhindered, and independent mobility. A complete ban on women migration was instituted until 2003. The ban was partially lifted in 2003 to allow women to migrate to work only in the formal sector, with domestic work still remaining banned. The ban was lifted in 2010 and again was imposed in 2012 to prevent any women below the age of 30 from travelling to the Middle East for domestic work. Bringing new rules of similar nature to control women’s liberty when there are pre-existing rules in place merely proves the inefficacy of such rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imposing such bans on women violates her right to equality, freedom of practising any profession, mobility, employment, and freedom to choose the type of employment. Without legal routes, women tend to opt for alternative channels to travel abroad for employment purposes, which increase their vulnerability to human trafficking and labour exploitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The restrictive rules targeted to women only are contradictory to the Constitution of Nepal and various international conventions Nepal is party to. The protectionist approach that government has been taking up time and again undermines the rights and freedoms of women. The protectionist approach has curtailed the employment opportunities and liberty of movement. This approach does not address the problems but rather works to reinforce patriarchy and deepens gender inequality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women’s Mass Protest</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attempt to institutionalise patriarchy with the proposed immigration rules and consecutive brutal rape and murder cases of teenage girls struck the final blow on the continued oppression and violence against women that women were facing. On February 12, hundreds of women marched on the streets of Kathmandu, protesting against the violence against women and demanding justice for victims of such violence. The protest was a result of exasperation of women on the government’s inaction and callousness towards women’s issues. Women rebelled against the systemic violence and bureaucracy that upholds patriarchal notions and felt the need to break the chains that keep women on a leash to maintain the traditionally imposed sanctity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women-led movement was significant and duly required to remind the government that women are not mere subjects of the state and that they need to do away with regressive laws that attempt to establish authority over women.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671344285_HB-Gandaki-MahilaRyalia-1536x1062.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-03-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:03:05', '2022-12-18 18:03:05'),

The limbo Nepal is in has triggered various security threats including growing activities of extremist groups that view the crisis as an opportunity for expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politicization of religion:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since Prime Minister Oli moved to dissolve the parliament, a decision which was overturned by the Supreme Court on February 23, he has been putting on show of sorts. He visited the Pashupatinath temple on January 25 and facilitated a special puja (worship) that lasted over an hour. Two weeks later, his faction of the NCP organized a mass gathering in front of the former royal palace where the Prime Minister’s supporters rallied around him and cheered him on during his speech. The optics of such events are difficult to ignore and appear to be Oli’s attempts to appease and garner sympathy from the pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu constituency. Pro-Hindu agenda has been gaining traction in Nepal, with some believing that a Hindu Nepal would also be a stepping stone for reinstating the monarchy. However, Nepal does not have to look far to see that the use of religion as political fodder can have dire consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hindutva push in Nepal is quite reminiscent of the Hindu extremism in India. Hindutva politics in Nepal’s southern neighbor India has promoted a form of intolerant majority rule that encourages discrimination and violence against the minorities. The mob violence unleashed upon the Muslims in February of last year was a result of government representatives using violent rhetoric in the name of nationalism and majoritarianism. Recent comments made by Tripura’s Chief Minister Biplav Dev on Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s alleged plans to ‘expand the party’s government in Nepal’ has also raised concerns. However, Hindu nationalist ideas and organizations such as RSS, imported from across the border have already found legitimacy in Nepal, further strengthened by the support of leaders like Kamal Thapa of the pro-Hindu and pro-monarchy Rashritya Prajatantra Party. As inappropriate as it is, the politicization of religion has been legitimized due to its potential to garner voters. However, the state embracing a particular religion sanctions the politics of hatred and violates the principle of democratic republicanism. Hindutva politics is emerging as a security threat as it is anti-minority, violent, undemocratic, and does not support Nepal’s secular identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential for peace with Biplav a farce?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A greater focus on mitigating the crisis created by the pandemic has inhibited the capacity of the government and security agencies, playing into the hands of the banned communist outfit led by Netra Bikram Chand (Biplav). Although the aim of the group is ambiguous, Biplav is leading trained former Maoist rebels with unknown quantity of arms, ammunition, and weapons. Recently, they have been scaling up their activities, from brutally murdering a local school teacher in Morang to planting bombs in various locations across Nepal, emerging as a security challenge for a country reeling under a global health crisis and political turmoil. However, meetings between the National Security Council and the cabinet have been frequent after Netra Bikram Chand (Biplav), the leader of the outlawed fringe of the Nepal Communist Party, issued a statement expressing willingness to hold talks with the government, asking for the ban against the group and its activities be lifted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authorities have suggested for the past few years that the government is willing to facilitate the journey of the group into mainstream politics. However, there had been no progress on that front until now. According to reports, the meeting discussed lifting the ban on the group and it is estimated that the Council of Ministers may declare the removal of the ban at the recommendation of the NSC. Even Prime Minister Oli has expressed readiness to reach an agreement with the outlawed group through dialogue. However, cadres of the group continue to be arrested from various locations across the country which make the efforts of holding dialogues with Biplav’s party seem insincere and politically motivated. Experts have said that “the government failed to make a proper assessment of the political and security dimensions of the group”. It appears that pursuing constructive dialogue with the group in an effort to create consensus and control activities is the pragmatic choice to make in the interest of national security.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671344427_Pro_Ktm_PM_1d-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-03-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:05:27', '2022-12-18 18:05:27');

Some differences among leaders persist as the process of political settlement is ongoing. The internal competition among leaders, directly linked to the interests and incentives of external actors, especially the private sector and foreign interests, are spilling over into politico-economic interests and international relations as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the Prime Minister’s deteriorating health, NCP appears more or less settled at the highest level. PM Oli has negotiated a power-sharing arrangement and has brought in Jhalanath Khanal closer; the former Prime Minister is now third in the party hierarchy. Bam Dev Gautam is the vice-chair, although not provided for by the party statute.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, party organizations are yet to merge into a cohesive whole at the provincial and local levels. It is even more challenging for individuals socialized in two different political cultures to blend emotionally and work together. Party cadres will find it difficult to let go of their previous identity as UML or Maoists. It is yet to be seen how the merger affects their identities up to the local levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe opposition parties are focussed on internal issues. Nepali Congress is holding internal negotiations for the general convention, generating debates about future leadership and direction, especially regarding the issue of Hinduism, monarchy, and citizenship. The upcoming general convention of the Nepali Congress will have significant implications, not just for rejuvenation of the party but also for Nepal’s democratic future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regards to Nepal’s national security, it is a risk if nationalism-based terrorist organizations from Pakistan decide to retaliate on the Kashmir issue. Traditionally, there have been activities of Pakistan-based terrorist groups in Nepal to attack India. Similar incidents might happen where the Pakistani militants may use the open border for their advantage to launch attacks in India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia appears to be reasserting itself in South Asia, including Nepal. The visit of India’s Foreign Minister Jaishanker was framed as an attempt to open a new chapter in Nepal-India relations as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina’s engagements in Nepal seem to have lost the pace and is being limited to Chinese interest in pushing forward commercial ventures the benefit of Chinese companies. High on the agenda is the much-talked-about visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping which will mean Nepal’s entry into a new partnership with China from where there will be no turning back. Nepal is at a historical high in terms of entering into partnerships and reap benefits through mutually beneficial relationship with the upcoming world powers in the immediate neighborhood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.NCP Merger<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe unification process of the NCP faced a considerable amount of strain with leaders claiming multiple forces trying to play on the differences within the party and among the leaders. A group claimed that the “establishment” close to PM Oli was delaying the process.[1] They alleged that PM Oli wanted to limit to the two co-chairs the authority to complete the unification process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe party is being run by an ad-hoc secretariat consisting of nine leaders: co-chairs KP Oli and Dahal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, Bamdev Gautam, Bishnu Paudel, Ram Bahadur Thapa Badal, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, and Ishwar Pokhrel. Dahal. Oli continues to have a major say in the political settlement process within the party, while others are struggling to assert themselves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe merger process is directly linked to the question of political settlement of how the political elites in the NCP contest distribution and organization of power in the party, which then facilitates their access to rents and accumulation of power in the running of the state. This internal competition is directly linked to the interests and incentives of external actors, especially the private sector actors and foreign interests. The conflict and contest for a political settlement are spilling over into politic0-economic interests and international relations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe key issue of contention between the erstwhile Maoist and the UML, the school department has been assigned to Ishwar Pokhrel. Nevertheless, differences among leaders persist as the process of the political settlement remains. On August 17, 2019, Dahal said he sometimes regrets unifying the party because a viable alternative communist party would have otherwise remained. He, however, said he was sure that Oli will abide by the past agreements.[2] On the contrary, a day later, PM KP Oli, in his parliamentary address, warned monarchists, defended the government’s performance and said he would lead the government until the next election.[3]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBamdev Gautam Back on Centrestage: Good politics is always driven by a charismatic leader. However, politics is always equivalent to power. Willam Clay said, “This is quite a game, politics. There are no permanent enemies, and no permanent friends, only permanent interests.”[4] The same theory is being applied in the political career of Bamdev Gautam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGautam’s alliance with Oli marks a significant readjustment of power equations in the party. Although Gautam had strongly backed Oli during the last general convention, Gautam had grown closer to Dahal. For a long time, Gautam’s opposition had considerably weakened PM Oli in the party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce again PM Oli has negotiated a power-sharing arrangement. He has brought in Jhalanath Khanal closer; the former Prime Minister is now third in the party hierarchy, and Bam Dev Gautam as the vice-chair, although not provided for by the party statute.[5]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChairman Oli also offered Bamdev Gautam to contest in the by-elections from Kaski-2.[6] Recently, the party picked Bamdev Gautam for the vice-chairman post.[7] Gautam also changed his political camp and taken responsibility for the chief of the organization department. [8]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGautam remained powerless after defeat in the federal election in 2017 with a slim margin of 758 votes with NC’s Sanjaya Kumar Gautam.[9] Since then, Gautam has struggled in the party. Gautam made attempts to join the parliament through by-elections in the constituency of Kathmandu-7[10], Dolpa, and Pyuthan.[11] He failed those attempts as the chairman duo were not interested. The kingmaker of the NCP merger remained without any responsibility. On many occasions, he put forth note of dissents in the party and secretariat meeting, which the duo always opposed.[12]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNCP has now moved into a new discourse as it concluded on the names of the joint chiefs of the seven provinces and chief of departments. The time is good for Gautam. The change in the power dynamics of NCP’s ad-hoc secretariat of the top nine remains among the top eight now. Leader Bamdev Gautam has once again come back in the power play. Chairman KP Oli has brought in Gautam as the vice-chairman.[13]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the new development, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Nepal nexus have reduced grip in the party.[14] The PM has strategically brought in Gautam-Dahal-Khanal with him and has a stronger grip on the party, while leader Madhav Nepal is alienated.[15]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn 16 August, the party secretariat promoted Bamdev Gautam to the post of vice-chair. Senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal moved down to the fourth position.[16] Amid dissatisfaction, Nepal registered a note of dissent.[17] He demanded that the party follow ‘one leader, one responsibility’ policy as per the statute. Nepal also urged for correction of an earlier decision on responsibilities.[18] Chairman Oli was not happy with Nepal’s note of dissent. The rift further increased, which ended in a row between the two before the PM left for Singapore for the second round of treatments within a month.[19]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPM’s Health: PM Oli returned to Singapore for his health treatment again and is expected to stay for 7-10 days.[20] He had stayed in Singapore for nine days earlier this month. Although Oli claimed his health is well[21] and is only going for adjustment of medicine doses, doctors later said he required plasmapheresis to control the amount of antibodies, indicating that he may require a second kidney transplant soon. He had his first transplant in 2007. Usually, a kidney transplant requires a hospital stay of around 4-5 days depending on the condition. The prognosis of the second transplant is usually as good as the first one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven Oli’s health condition, one of the most important issues is the question of succession. President Bidya Devi Bhandari is alleged to have been actively involved in the design and implementation of the new political settlement in the party, where Bam Dev Gautam, who now heads the organization department, may become the de jure successor to Oli.[22] Gautam is once again back at the center stage of the NCP. Considering Oli’s deteriorating health, Gautam, the party vice-chair, is set on a path to succeed Oli to continue NCP Government until its full term. This would, however, require Gautam’s election from a vacant constituency.[23]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, fears, interests, and needs of party leaders will continue to drive the party’s policies and practices. In particular, the Maoists leaders are beset by fear of prosecution over war crimes during the People’s War and International Criminal Court in Hague to maintain tight control over the party [24] and top-level political leaders expressed genuine concerns about the possibility of foreign countries using global human rights jurisdiction to prosecute individuals implicated in war crimes in the absence of transitional justice in Nepal. Such concerns will continue to determine the process of unification, policies, and potential alliances in the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNCP appears more or less settled at the highest level; however, party organizations are yet to merge into a cohesive whole at the provincial and local levels. It is even more challenging for individuals socialized in two different political cultures to blend emotionally and work together. Party cadres will find it difficult to let go of their previous identity as UML or Maoists. It is yet to be seen how the merger affects their identities up to the local levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB. Opposition politics<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe opposition parties are focused on internal issues. Nepali Congress is holding internal negotiations for the general convention generating debates about future leadership and direction, especially regarding the issue of Hinduism, monarchy, and citizenship. The upcoming general convention of the Nepali Congress—likely to be held after 18 months—will have significant implications for the party’s rejuvenation and Nepal’s democratic future given the intense contest for leadership, its role as a democratic opposition, and its ability to compete with the communists. Many party leaders inisist that Sher Bahadr Deuba must retire if the party is to be reformed.[25] The Rastriya Janata Party, meanwhile, is holding unification talks with Samajbadi Party Nepal to provide an alternative to the Nepali Congress and the Nepal Communist Party but the strategy is generating internal dissent in the parties; the question of leadership is turning out to be a major sticking point.[26] If the merger takes place, the forces represented by Upendra Yadav, Baburam Bhattarai, and Mahantha Thakur, among others, has the potential to become the third pole in Nepali politics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome party workers of Biplav’s Communist Party of Nepal (Biplav), who have been arrested by the police, are “surrendering,” or renouncing the party and violence,[27] while an affiliate of the party has announced action against what it calls the “education mafia.”[28] The government continues to crack down on the party, arresting members[29] while the ruling Nepal Communist Party is trying to woo party workers into its fold. The police have filed more than 1781 cases against Biplav’s party workers.[30]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInternal dissent and differences within the Nepal Communist Party generated a discourse about the success of the current political system—Federal Democratic Republic—and the possibility of a “regime change.” Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda issued contradictory statements this month, sometimes warning[31] forces trying to reverse recent political changes, even as he warned that the current regime could be ousted from power if the communists did not mend their ways.[32] Similarly, Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli has also been attacking the pro-monarchy forces,[33] indicating that the ruling regime sees the pro-monarchy movement and Biplav’s maoist movement as a political threat.[34] PM Oli has been calling upon parties and leaders to bolster the current political system ahead of his visit to Singapore for medical treatment.[35] It could also be a strategy to garner political support from the mainstream parties and leaders by raising the spectre of the pro-monarchists and maoists. Meanwhile, PM Oli is trying to maintain control over the constitutional bodies by overseeing their fiscal matters.[36]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC. Security and Strategic Affairs<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCitizenship Bill: The debate on equal provision for both foreign men and women marrying Nepali citizen to acquire Nepali citizenship is going on. Some lawmakers oppose it, stating it as an issue of nationalism, not equality. But, the issue is all about equality. The nation becomes weak in a true sense when equality and civil rights are denied to its citizens. If the leaders find it as a threat towards the nation, a solution can be found, not limiting the rights of citizens.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Citizenship Bill registered in the House of Representatives a year ago is yet to be endorsed. This bill has remained stuck at the Parliamentary State Affairs and Good Governance Committee as lawmakers of ruling and opposition party have not yet decided on the naturalized citizenship for foreign spouses and their children.[37] Some lawmakers demand seven years of threshold period for foreign women marrying Nepali men while some argue immediate citizenship provision, as s/he would be deprived of public services including education, employment, and other rights. [38]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Constitution of Nepal 2072 has clearly mentioned children of people who have citizenship by birth can get citizenship by descent, but the disputes are yet to be settled in the parliament.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than half a million citizens remain deprived of opportunities for education, employment, government jobs, and even to open bank accounts.[39] The constitution of Nepal 2072 is said to be the most progressive constitution, but under this constitution, people are being deprived of their basic human rights. The parliament remains indifferent in promoting the rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKashmir Issue: With the escalation of tension between Pakistan and India, the international communities have contradicting statements, leaving only China to support Pakistan. On the other hand, countries have been supporting India’s stance on the issue, saying that engagement in Kashmir is India’s internal matter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia being a trade giant, most of the countries have economic and diplomatic relations with it. These countries do not want to put their relations at risk by siding with Pakistan. Even the allies of Pakistan from West Asia have described the issue to be India’s internal matter, as the country has recently concluded a major energy deal with India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndian government informed its neighboring countries including Nepal about the Kashmir issue. Indian ambassador to Nepal, Manjeev Puri briefed FM Pradeep Gyawali about the current status in Kashmir, while the foreign secretary of India met Nepali officials from the Nepali Embassy in Delhi to talk about the issue.[40]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinister Gyawali said that the issue of Jammu &amp; Kashmir should be solved through negotiations and dialogues, and Nepal is in favor of regional peace and stability, but Nepal has not made an official stance on the issue.[41]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPakistan’s PM Imran Khan said that if India commits any type of violence, Pakistan will fight back till the end and will teach Delhi a lesson.[42]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina and Russia took a divergent stand on the Kashmir issue. China, in support to Pakistan, is trying to initiate the issue at the UN, while Russia stands to discourage any consultation regarding the subject. In an official statement, Russia clearly said that the issue should be solved bilaterally through diplomacy.[43]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNeither the government nor the media in Nepal have written about the issue in context to Nepal. Nepal making no official comments on the issue may have links with the recent visit of the RAW chief to Nepal. As the agendas for the visit was not made public, India might have warned Nepal about the official uprising initiated by India in Kashmir.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn connection to the issue, Nepal’s national security is at risk if nationalism-based terrorist organizations from Pakistan decides to retaliate. Traditionally, there have been activities of Pakistan-based terrorist group in Nepal to attack India. Similar incidents might happen where the Pakistani militants may use the porous border for their advantage to launch attacks in India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, Nepal’s secular status is at risk as Modi made an attempt to seize power from the only Muslim majority region of India. It is evident that Modi is trying to push Hinduism in Nepal.[44] During his trips to Nepal, he visited Hindu temples and pilgrimages to promote the religion. If not fully, Modi might put some pressure on Nepal to promote Hinduism in the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD. International Relations<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal-China: China’s engagements in Nepal appear to have lost momentum although China continues to push forward commercial ventures that benefit Chinese companies. High on the agenda is the much-talked-about visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping. If Xi Jinping visits Nepal, it will mean Nepal has entered a new partnership with China from which there will be no turning back. However, the visit remains uncertain until now, given Nepal’s lack of preparation regarding BRI, foreign policy, and security. In the last few months, there have been several set-backs for China. The third series of Sagarmatha joint military exercise with China, slated to be held in August, is uncertain. An online media reported that the two countries are yet to start formal discussions about the event.[45]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn June, Minister Barshaman Pun requested the Chinese ambassador to facilitate timely completion of projects awarded to Chinese companies.[46] He was referring to two Chinese contractors working in Trishuli A and Kulekhani III. The Chinese ambassador responded on Twitter with two photographs of Upper Tamakoshi, saying that the largest among the hydropower projects being constructed in Nepal is by a Chinese company, the Sinohydro Corporation.[47] According to ABC Nepal, Minister Pun’s request did not go well with the Chinese, and they questioned whether they were his own words.[48] In the last seven years, Nepal has received Rs 31 billion from China out of its total commitment of Rs 112 billion.[49]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) is unlikely to request for Chinese help to construct storage facilities for fuel imports. NOC officials say the public enterprise will try to construct the facilities by itself.[50]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Huaxin Cement Company which was reported to have obtained land through illegal means is now complaining of obstacles from political interest groups affiliated to a member of parliamentarian Rajendra Pandey. News media reported that if the situation continues, Huaxin could be forced to disinvest. While political interest groups close to PM Oli are supporting the cement company, those close to Madhav Kumar Nepal are opposing it.[51]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInformal conversations with western diplomats and officials indicate that the process of globalization has reached a stage where global cultural and economic integration will be tested by concerns about China’s rise. Adoption of deep technology and integration of infrastructure, trade, and financial connectivity may create a systemic and technological dependence on China from which developing countries may be unable to wean themselves. In addition, alliance with China could lead to the creation of a global bloc that ignores issues of human rights, freedom, and democracy, promoting totalitarian and non-democratic regimes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, on economic engagement with China, there are some positive developments as well. Union Pay has become the first Chinese company to receive a license as a payment systems operator. China is pushing ahead for the construction of the second phase of the Ring Road, while Chinese financial institutions are planning to increase investments in Nepal’s infrastructure sector.[52] The Chinese Ambassador also reviewed Chinese projects and the performance of Chinese companies in Nepal. Jhalanath Khanal is visiting China for five days in August at the invitation of the Chinese Communist Party.[53] While Nepal Airlines awaits to get a slot in China, Himalaya Airlines, patronized by PM K P Oli is planning to fly to five destinations in China from October, including the new Daxing airport in Beijing.[54] Nepal and China have completed the pre-feasibility study of the Ratmate-Kerung 5000-KV transmission line connecting China and Nepal, pushed first by PM Oli. Nepal is expected to continue the feasibility study for the 80-km long transmission line which passes through Langtang National Park. The Office of the Investment Board has given permission to two Chinese companies to prepare a detailed project report for the Rs 64-billion China-Nepal Friendship Industrial Park in Damak, Jhapa[55] after approving the investment proposal of Lhasa Economic and Technology Development Zone. The Park will be built on 2200 bighas of land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPresident Xi’s probable Nepal Visit: In April, President Bidya Devi Bhandari went on a nine-day state visit to China and met the Chinese premier Xi Jinping extending an invitation to her counterpart for a state visit to Nepal[56]. Since then there has been much debate and deliberation in the country as to when Xi Jinping would decide to take up Bhandari on her invitation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the same time, questions have been raised on the kind of impact of such a high-level visit to Nepal. According to Dr. Dinesh Bhattarai, a foreign affairs expert, such a visit does not automatically equate that China is making Nepal its priority[57]. It means that amidst news of Indian PM Narendra Modi being invited as chief guest for Nepal’s Constitution Day, Xi’s visit will simply tip the scales back into a position of balance. A diplomatic visit must still be augmented by effective negotiation skills on the Nepalese end to bring to the table primary bilateral issues. Even with such a visit, if the leadership is unable to promulgate key projects under the BRI and create a working a working mechanism, the visit will have only served a perfunctory function.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the purview of public diplomacy, a possible visit from Xi Jinping will create acute pressure on Nepal’s geopolitical importance and could warrant a response from India. However until a foreign policy is molded by the understanding for the Chinese the BRI is a pathway to promote commercial and business interests through Nepal to India, such visits will not have much effect[58]. Through the aforementioned understanding, Nepali foreign policy must act on a mutually beneficial plan that will reap satisfaction on both ends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile such discussions continue it is important to analyze how prepared the country is for such a high-level visit and where it lacks in diplomatic preparations. With ‘quiet preparations’ having allegedly begun for President Xi’s visit, some of the concerns were that of security, the Tribhuvan International Airport’s runway and arrangements for an appropriate stay for the Chinese premier[59]. The government officials have not been able to confirm if the visit has been confirmed, however, Chinese security teams have recently visited the country to assess the station with the police and the armed forces. Furthermore, the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) was asked to reschedule its Global Convention, earlier marked for October 13th to the 16th. Keeping all of these factors in mind, expectations are at an all-time high for President Jinping’s visit as he has already paid a visit to all other South-Asian countries and may visit Nepal as a detour after his visit to India[60].<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHong Kong Protest: Nepal will not be involved regarding the issue in any manner. Nepal firmly supports One China Policy and will never go against China openly. The protest involves indirect involvement of powerful countries, and Nepal should not interfere in the matter, putting its democratic image in jeopardy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protest in Hong Kong kicked off to denounce the extradition bill but now has triggered a series of ongoing demonstration for democracy. Both the protestors and the security forces are using violent means, evolving the campaign into mass disruptions every day. The anti-government protest crippled Hong Kong airport as well. The peaceful demonstrations, in the beginning, have now turned out ugly with the protestors beating people and also forcing the airport to completely close down for two days.[61]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUS President Donald Trump urged Xi Jinping to sit down and negotiate with the protestors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrump tweeted, “I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it.”[62]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn support of the protest, Foreign Affairs Committee of Britain suggested the British government to give full nationality to the citizens of Hong Kong.[63]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina reacted furiously on this issue and termed the protest to be ‘terrorist-like’.[64] China’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, announced that “China will not sit back and watch, and the country possesses enough power and solutions to quell the unrest swiftly.” Liu also warned other countries not to interfere in China’s internal matter regarding the protest.[65]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal-India: After years of relative indifference to Nepal’s political course, foreign relations, and development process, India appears to be reasserting itself in South Asia, including Nepal. The visit of India’s Foreign Minister Jaishanker was framed as an attempt to open a new chapter in Nepal-India relations.[66] However, Nepal has already started several high-profile economic engagements with China, from which there would be no turning back. This means that the current regime would continue to try to engage both Nepal and India. Although Oli has warmed up to India’s overtures, his government is seeking to establish nationalist credentials by pushing forward the report of the Eminent Persons Group and announcing the intention to start Pancheswor from scratch as indicated by Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali at the Reporters Club.[67]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal-India Joint Commission Meeting: The joint commission meeting is jointly held by Nepal and India to focus on expediting and planning an implementation of the efforts undertaken by the bilateral visits between the two countries. Nepal and India take turns to host the joint commission meeting. The first and third meetings were held in 1988 and 2014 in Nepal, while the second and fourth meetings were held in India in 1991 and 2016. The fifth one was recently held in Kathmandu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali headed the 35-member Nepali delegation to the talks. The agenda for the meeting had been grouped under five categories-politics, security and border issues; connectivity and economic cooperation; commerce and transit; energy and water resources, culture, education; and the EPG report and others.[68]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Indian delegation to the talks was headed by External Affairs Minister of India Subrahmanyam Jaishankar who arrived in Kathmandu on August 22 for the meeting. During his stay, Jaishankar called on President Bidya Devi Bhandari and PM KP Sharma Oli.[69] Minister Gyawali expressed that Nepal-India bilateral relations were now more focused on economic cooperation, evident from progress implementation of past agreements as Motihari-Amlekhgunj petroleum pipelines, integrated checkpoints in Birgunj and Biratnagar, and Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, it is important to note that the Eminent Persons Groups (EPG) formed under Prime Ministers Modi and Oli has acted outside the Terms of Reference (ToR). According to the ToR, the 1950 treaty is within the ambit of the EPG. However, the group has decided to table the discussion for the 1950 treaty under a separate umbrella. This does not follow the spirit of the ToR and may cause problems in future discussions. The EPG also raised the issue of the Gurkha soldiers as they were involved in cross-border security around Kashmir.[70] It was also noted that due to the urgency of the Kashmir issue, there seemed to be a preoccupation with that over the bilateral talks with Nepal.[71]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and India signed various agreements with India, namely handing over cheques amounting to Rs 3.74 billion for two projects for post-earthquake reconstruction and postal highway project in Nepal. An MoU was signed between the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (DFTQC) of Nepal on food safety and standards. On the occasion, Indian government handed over a cheque of Rs. 2.45 billion towards reimbursement to Nepali government for post-earthquake housing reconstruction in Nuwakot and Gorkha districts. Similarly, the Indian government also handed over a cheque worth INRS 801.1 million (RS. 1.29 billion) to Nepal towards strengthening road infrastructure in the Tarai region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia provided financial assistance for post-earthquake housing construction as the victims were still living in shelters. This financial commitment had been made by the Late Ms. Sushma Swaraj and had been pending for the last four years[72]. During the meeting, both sides reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral relations with a specific focus of connectivity and economic partnership, trade, transit, water resource, culture, and education.[73]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinister for External Affairs Pradeep Kumar Gyawali briefed the House of Representatives on the issues discussed and key decisions made. Minister Gyawali said that the meeting directed the secretariat to make necessary preparation for submitting the EPG report and foreign secretaries to come up with ideas to review the 1950 Peace and Friendship Treaty. Gyawali also shared that the government was in talks with the British government regarding the revision of tripartite agreement between Nepal, Britain, and India concerning British Gurkha soldiers.[74]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile in an interview with The Himalayan Times the minister confirmed that the meeting discussed border mapping, inundation, extradition treaty and EPG report in great details. The minister shared that there was no discussion on the Kashmir issue. Likewise, on Pakistan’s request seeking Nepal to speak on Kashmir as SAARC chair, he maintained that Nepal would focus on domestic matters and not get involved in other’s issues.[75]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE. Democracy and Federalism<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s governance system took a new formation and entered the federal system after the promulgation of the Constitution in 2015. Four years later, the Federal Democratic Republic was ensured, the unitary mindset continues to defy the rules and the purpose of the federal design. As per the constitutional mandate, the government formed the National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission (NNRFC) constituted with significant responsibility for the balanced development, budget, and natural resources management.[76]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, even after one and a half year of the formation of the NNRFC, not much has been delivered with regards to natural resources sharing and ownership and various disputes remain unresolved. As per the commission’s recommendation, the government set budget limits for local and provincial governments. But some local governments complained that the allocated budget was not enough. The commission has to allocate the budget at any cost but it is creating disputes among the local governments on sharing natural resources. Due to lack of Acts regarding the natural resources distribution, disputes in the natural resource sharing is increasing with each passing day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe disputes majorly are between federal with provincial, federal with local, and provincial with local governments. A number of disputes have been seen regarding resources such as rivers, jungles, and irrigation projects. The locals have put their effort and time to preserve natural resources. In this case, there is a lack of rule related to the sharing of natural resources. The federal and provincial government also have a claim on natural resources available in their provinces and localities. The government should share ownership base and benefits of the natural resources considering maximum rights to the ones who are nearest to the resources and who deserve it. The commission should come up with a modality on how to divide the usability of the natural resources among the users or else the disputes may cause serious conflicts and could cost dear to the newly established Federal Democratic Republic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGovernance and Development: The government is pushing for major infrastructure projects, even as cases of corruption and irregularities continue to pose serious obstacles.[77][78] There are problems in Kathmandu Terai expressway,[79] Beni-Jomsom-Korala road,[80] construction of roads in Kathmandu,[81] Melamchi drinking water project and Tanahu hydropower project.[82] Many public enterprises are facing critical problems. While Udayapur Cement has been shut down during peak season,[83] Nepal Telecom’s profit has fallen by 42 per cent[84] and Nepal Airlines continues to suffer losses forcing the government to form a study committee.[85] Another state owned enterprise, NOC is exploiting consumers by selling petroleum at double the purchase price.[86] Newly inducted Minister of Tourism, Yogesh Bhattarai is promoting Nijgarh as his priority.[87]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJudiciary: Former chief justices and justices said that there was a need to work jointly with the stakeholders to protect the integrity of the judiciary. The judiciary is in the critical stage because of its working style and the recent appointments made.[88] Former Judges Forum-Nepal plans to scrutinize some of the recent judgments passed by the Supreme Court to inform the public as to how those judgments contradicted the jurisprudence established in the past.[89]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe recent action of the Judicial Council (JC) against some judges of Biratnagar High Court (BHC) has sparked a debate in the legal sector. Experts have called for striking a balance while taking punitive action against the erring judges.[90] The JC had taken punitive action against some BHC judges for passing erroneous order in the 33.5-kg gold smuggling and Sanam Shakya-murder case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, in another JC action, expressing dissatisfaction over the investigation into his judgment, Judge Jiwan Hari Adhikri, who was serving at the Pokhara High Court, tendered his resignation to Chief Justice Cholendra SJB Rana. Adhikari decided to put in his papers stating that some people tried to drag him into controversy.[91] He was being probed by the Judicial Council for issuing orders beyond his jurisdiction in a case filed by Gorkha Brewery.[92]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTharuhat Movement: August 24 marked four years since the Tikapur incident when nine people, including a police officer and a toddler, were killed. The clash was a result of festering discontent among Tharus against a campaign called ‘Akhanda Sudurpaschim’, or Undivided Far West which was backed by the leaders of major parties. Despite the protests, the constitution was passed on September 20, 2015, with the Madhesi parties refusing to sign the document. An amendment was passed on January 23, 2016.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a bid to maintain social harmony and deal with the emotional and psychological trauma of the violence, a three-day Tharuhat/Tharuwan conference was held there from August 24-26, 2019.[93] The conference ended with the formation of 101-committee National Tharuhat Tharuwan Front (NTTF) and a 15-point declaration demanding the unconditional release of Tharu people, along with Tharu MP Resham Chaudhary and 11 other, who are serving jail terms for their alleged involvement in the Tikapur incident.[94] Tharu leader Laxman Tharu, who is also the chairman of NTTF said that the Tharu movement is for all the indigenous and marginalized people and that the 2072 constitution be amended and the Lal Commission report be made public.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther, the front will launch a promotional campaign for its expansion in the first phase, corner meetings, rallies, and demonstrations will be held in Tarai districts in the second phase. Stick and torch rallies will be held in Tharu-majority regions and non-cooperation agitation will be launched targeting the government in the third phase.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the inaugural session of the conference, Baburam Bhattarai, Sanghiya Samajbadi Party Nepal leader, said that the Tikapur incident was purely political in nature and it happened during a struggle for rights. The security situation was tight as even former Prime Minister Baburam Battarai had to go through thorough security checking from the armed police. The armed police could be seen in many parts of the town and at every entry point to Tikapur as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nF. Gender<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrafficking in Person: The government of Nepal stopped issuing work permits to domestic help on July 2016 for Gulf countries and Malaysia. However, the protectionist measure of the government has failed to deter agents active in sending women to those countries for domestic works through illegal means as the government officials collude with agents of human trafficking. It was reported that around 35,000 persons, including 15,000 women and 500 girls were victims of human trafficking in 2018-19.[95] The crime continues to thrive due to government’s inability to crack down on trafficking rackets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParliamentary panel study reported that as much as 60% Nepali women employed as housemaids in the Gulf left for the destination from Tribhuvan International Airport on tourist visa. Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) arrested an immigration official from Kathmandu Airport for allegedly colluding with agents to grant departure permissions to youths on tourist visas for labor abroad.[96]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a bid to control and prevent human trafficking, the federal government, Ministry of Federal Affairs, and General Administration directed all local levels to implement the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe human rights watchdog in its report on ‘Trafficking in Persons-2019’, had made a number of recommendations to the federal government, provincial governments, and local levels to reinforce the fight against human trafficking.[97]</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671344606_rupani-nursery-planting-saplings-daily-work15-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-08', '2019-10-17', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:08:26', '2022-12-18 18:08:26');

A number of writ petitions were filed with more than 300 lawyers names enlisted for litigating the case. The hearing of the case began on December 25, 2020 after which the Supreme Court shifted the case before the constitutional bench. Further, there were deliberations as to whether a full bench can adjudicate upon the particular matter or whether it is only the prerogative of a constitutional bench. The advocates stated that the Constitution of Nepal, 2015 has clearly laid down that the matters concerning the constitution should only be heard before a constitutional bench.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially the bench comprised of Chief Justice Cholendra SJB Rana and Justices Anil Kumar Sinha, Tej Bahadur KC, Bishowamber Shrestha and Hari Krishna Karki. A controversy loomed with respect to appointment of Justice Hari Krishna Karki as one of the judges, since he had served as Attorney General during the tenure of PM KP Sharma Oli. The bench inclusive of Justice Karki would amount to conflict of interest. Therefore, Justice Karki recused himself and Justice Sapana Pradhan Malla was appointed in his place. Similarly, Senior advocate Geeta Pathak Sangruala, Purna Man Shakya, Satish Krishna Kharel, Bijay Kant Mainali and Badri Bahadur Karki were appointed as amicus curiae (experts who are unbiased towards either party and help the Court with required information and advice to furnish a judgement).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Issue of the Case</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case essentially deliberated upon the constitutionality of the parliament dissolution, wherein Article 76 (1), (7) and Article 85 of the Constitution were invoked. As per Article 85, the tenure of the parliament is of five years ‘unless dissolved earlier pursuant to this Constitution.’[1] Article 76 stipulates the conditions under which the house can be dissolved. Dissolution of the house is only delved into clause 7 of Article 76 which states that “In cases where the Prime Minister appointed under clause 5 fails to obtain a vote of confidence or the Prime Minister cannot be appointed, the President shall, on recommendation of the Prime Minister, dissolve the House of Representative and appoint a date of election so that the election to another House of Representative is completed within six months.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the house cannot be dissolved without the president having used up all avenues to form a government. These avenues are forming government by: leader of single largest party, or any member who could command a majority, or a leader of Majority party or largest coalition party. On simply reading Article 76, it is understood that the purpose of this Article is to form the government and in case of failure thereof even after various endeavours; house dissolution can take place to carry out new elections. The dissolution cannot happen in any other circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legislative intent behind the limited conditions under the particular Article is to circumvent the frequency of house dissolution to maintain political stability. The Constitution of 1990 had expressly bestowed the power to dissolve the house to the executive head under Article 53. This power led to political instability with multiple instances of parliament dissolution. Therefore, rectifying the blunder, such provisions were intentionally excluded from the new constitution to avoid such a situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reasoning of the Government</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequent to the petitioner’s pleading, the presentation of defendant’s argument began on February 1. Attorney General Agni Kharel representing the government as chief counsel along with a team of advocates who presented the arguments on behalf of the government. The counsel mostly reiterated PM Oli’s reason for dismantling the house citing Article 76 and 85. He stated that the Prime Minister exercised ‘inherent powers’ while recommending house dissolution. Nevertheless, there was no material constitutional ground to support his claim. The lead counsel on the defendant side struggling to present concrete arguments speaks volumes in itself. He further stated that the dissolution of parliament was a political move and does not require judicial review. Upon being cross questioned, Kharel was unable to provide a concrete justification and just gave feeble answers which further weakened the case for defendants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, senior advocate Dr Surendra Bhandari presented 7 points before the court justifying that the Prime Minister was well within his rights to dissolve the parliament. These 7 points are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>He argues, Article 76 (1) has not restricted the executive head to dissolve parliament, Article 66 (1) read with Article 76 (7) allows the Prime Minister to dissolve parliament.</li>\r\n	<li>As per Article 76, there are three ways in which the Prime Minister can be appointed, out of which the Prime Minister Oli is appointed under clause 1.</li>\r\n	<li>There is no limitation in Executive right under Article 75. All the powers except administrative and judicial rights are vested with the Prime Minister.</li>\r\n	<li>He cited Article 2, 56, 57, 66, 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, and 100 as the basis to dissolve the house.</li>\r\n	<li>The constitution has conferred residuary powers to the executive head and the right to dissolve the parliament falls within the scope of residuary power.</li>\r\n	<li>He cited precedents wherein prime minister with majority had dissolved the parliament. The precedents showed that only the president with no majority could not dissolve the parliament.</li>\r\n	<li>The Prime Minister appointed under 76 (1) does not require vote of confidence.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the judicial review of political matters, the precedents suggest that the Court has the jurisdiction to intervene where the political move is infringes the constitution, regardless of whether it clashes with politics. Moreover, the argument of inherent powers presented by the defendants does not stand where the written constitution prevails. The powers bestowed upon the prime minister needs to be univocally mentioned in the constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supreme Court’s Verdict</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court after hearing the arguments of both sides asked the amicus curie to provide their insight vis-à-vis the case. The members of amicus curiae presented conflicting arguments. The court taking into account the arguments of both side as well as the amicus curie delivered a historical judgment of reinstating the parliament on February 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court got a perfect opportunity to interpret the constitutional provisions and clear out ambiguities in the constitution surrounding Article 76. However, the Court applying textualist approach (statutory interpretation of plain text to determine meaning of the legislation) interpreted the constitution narrowly. The judgment delivered was very fact specific and it did not comprehend potential/probable situation wherein the house dissolution could take place. It simply stated that the for house dissolution to be constitutional it has to fulfil all the pre-requisites under Article 76.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn parliament dissolution is ground-breaking. The Court’s decision has not only upheld the supremacy of the constitution and rule of law but also restored the faith of people in the judiciary to a certain extent. The Court’s resistance towards the populist leader in delivering an unbiased judgement honouring the values and spirit of the Constitution is laudable. This judgment has reaffirmed the separation of powers and fortified democratic norms.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Article 85, the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Article 76 (7), the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Article 76 (3), the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Article 76 (5), the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Article 76 (1), the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Article 76 (2), the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Article 53, the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671344788_PM-1536x986.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-03-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:11:28', '2022-12-18 18:11:28'),

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit was followed by that of a delegation of the Chinese Communist Party which participated in a joint symposium with the Nepal Communist Party. Diplomatic events by China, combined with internal dynamics in Nepali politics, have generated debates and discussions in the Nepali media about Nepal-China relations, exposed differences and confusions in Nepal’s foreign policy and caused setbacks for US diplomacy. Although China’s strategy and approach regarding relation with Nepal is becoming coherent, how such relations will actually materialize or shape Nepal-China relations is not clear. Similarly, Nepal’s relation with China is also under duress given competing interests within the Nepali society and efforts by the US and India to limit China’s influence in Nepal. In such a situation, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal will have significant implications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal-China Relations<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring his three-day visit to Nepal in September, Foreign Minister Wang Yi met various leaders and dignitaries—including Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Prime Minister KP Oli, President Bidya Devi Bhandari, and Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali—conveying carefully curated messages. China confirms that Nepal is an integral component in its neighborhood policy as “China and Nepal have been connected by mountains and rivers and enjoy ever-lasting friendship.”[1] The second identifiable element is that of China’s pledge to priorities the vision of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepal”[2] This adage is supplemented by China’s desire to strongly support Nepal in “exploring a development path in line with its national conditions.”[3]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina is portraying itself as a stronger proponent for Nepal’s social and political development. It has promised to jointly push forward the Belt and Road Initiative with a special mention of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network in order to transform Nepal from a land-locked country to a land-linked country.[4] However, there was no mention of the railway project, merely a commitment to expand connectivity which in its vagueness could mean only road connectivity or may even extend to a rail link. Wang Yi also outlined that the Chinese side is looking forward to working “jointly” with the Nepali government to deepen such ties. This means that Nepal must not participate in such talks with an expectation of being the sole beneficiary but must approach it as a cooperative project between the two countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn China’s security concerns in Nepal; the Chinese Foreign Ministry carefully marked its appreciation for Nepalese foreign policy which stands resolute in support of a One China Policy and its refusal to allow any anti-China activities on Nepali soil[5]. Pushpa Kamal Dahal allegedly went as far as making a statement condoning the Hong Kong protests, dubbing the recent upheaval as “terrorism in the name of human rights.”[6]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeijing relayed another message through Wang Yi that Nepal and China are entering a new chapter in their diplomatic relations, a chapter that is being pushed by new historical conditions and will bring more cultural exchanges and partnerships[7]. Prominent Chinese news agencies such as the Xinhua and the China Daily have also carried articles covering Wang’s visit to Nepal outline these five elements as China’s priority in Nepal. To conclude, these five elements showcased by Wang Yi’s visit to Nepal will serve as a compass to navigate Chinese foreign policy in Nepal. During Wang’s visit, three deals were signed—two infrastructure agreements and one on public diplomacy, under which China would be sending volunteer teachers to Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nXi Jinping Thought<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn September 25, the ruling Nepal Communist Party and the Communist Party of China formalized their sisterly relations by signing a six-point agreement that promises high-level political exchange, people-to-people relations, study visits, ideological interactions and cooperation between the two parties. Head of the International Affairs Department of the Nepal Communist Party, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and Chief of International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China, Song Tao, signed the agreement in the presence of both PM K.P Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal. More than 200 leaders participated in the symposium.[8]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBishnu Rijal, in a social media post, highlighted the five major areas where agreements were signed. First, there was a promise to increase high-level visits between the two parties, second, there should be a continuance in ideological training from China to Nepali communist leaders. Third, there should be an extension in sharing communist ideology and experience and fourth, training should also percolate to lowest levels. Lastly, there should be increased discourse between the developmental models of the two countries as Nepal has much to learn from the Chinese model[9]. Each of these points was supplemented by presentations by Chinese leaders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the symposium, the Chinese Communist Party explained the Xi Jinping Thought and held ideological discussions with the Nepal Communist Party members. NCP leaders praised China, its leadership, and its ideology. Prime Minister Oli in his speech as chief guest stated that “countries, after becoming powerful, tended to dominate other countries, China never did so[10].” This, in his opinion, makes China’s system better than the rest of the worlds.’ PM Oli, while eulogizing Xi Jinping Thought, however, said there were differences in the characteristics of communist parties of Nepal and the Chinese Communist Party.[11] Pushpa Kamal Dahal too praised CPC’s ‘socialism with Chinese characteristics’ stating that through their ideology system the party had gained legitimacy and longevity in China[12]. Most of the communist leaders have expressed their admiration for the Chinese political system and hail the dominant one party system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNCP’s deputy chief of the party school, Bedu Ram Bhusal said the symposium was aimed at “renewing relations between the communist parties of the two countries” after the unification of the CPN-UML and CPN-MC into NCP.[13] The symposium, however, generated public discussions about whether China was engaging in ideological indoctrination of “Xi Jinping Thought.” There were also internal differences in the Nepal Communist Party over Xi ideology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComments from the Chinese indicated that they were promoting Xi Xinping Thought as the basis of a new international order and the promotion of such thought in Nepal could weave its neighbor into that order. China appears to approach Nepal Communist Party in at least three ways: as a source of stability in Nepali politics, as a source of stability in Nepal’s relations with China, and as a vehicle for weaving Nepal into a global order based on the Chinese model. For example, during the political symposium, the Chinese politicians placed emphasis on adopting the Chinese party discipline and discussed how the communist party could be organized in a better way. A senior NCP official said that the Chinese want to maintain a sustained and friendly relationship with Nepal and are constantly trying to make sense of who would lead the NCP over the longer term. China expects the NCP to remain in a strong position at all the three levels of the government in the federal context.[14]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery year, China has been inviting 30 persons from the Nepal Communist Party, 15 from the former Maoists and 15 from the former UML. This year, they said they wanted to organize the event in Nepal, said a senior party official. So they asked for an invitation from Madhav Kumar Nepal, the head of the international affairs department, while the event was organized by the party school led by Ishwar Pokharel. Despite the program being hosted by NCP party school, the Chinese sought to appease Madhav Kumar Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most significant concern was that China is attempting to export its political ideology to the NCP which would allow for it to fulfill out its economic and security interests with ease.[15] Following widespread criticism about indoctrination, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi was forced to clarify the next day, saying China does not export its ideology to other countries. However, she said that “in-depth discussion about Xi Jinping Thought is helpful for the exploration of new developmental ideas for all countries, and for developing countries in particular.” At the same event hosted by China Study Center and the Chinese Embassy, Minister Ishwar Pokhrel said Xi Jinping Thought offered a basis for finding solutions to global affairs and was accepted internationally.[16] Ambassador Hou Yangqi was present in the symposium, indicating an official relationship between the Chinese state and the Nepal Communist Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInconsistencies in Nepal’s foreign policy and setbacks for the US<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiple sources in the Nepal Communist Party said there’s confusion as well as differences in the party regarding foreign policy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne foreign relations expert in the party recalled his personal experience with K P Oli, saying the NCP leader has been showing disdain to the idea of non-alignment as a foreign policy for the last 2-3 years. He said PM Oli once asked him, why he was still talking about non-alignment. Although the Nepal Communist Party still officially maintains a policy of non-alignment, such a policy may be under duress given the growing relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNCP general secretary Ishwar Pokhrel sought to use the event to bolster his position in the party by appearing close to the Chinese. He also sought to sell himself to the Chinese as the future of the party. Ghanashyam Bhusal, meanwhile, was largely ignored by all the groups in the party, he had no major presence during the symposium except for a paper he presented about China’s rise and its implications for communist ideology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTalking to CESIF, Surendra Pandey outlined some reasons why the NCP is unlikely to adopt socialism with Chinese characteristics. The first is the supposed incompatibility between Maoism and the political-economic conditions of Nepal—it is no longer a semi-feudal state. While the former Maoists may be closer to Chinese ideology, the former UML has clearly discarded Maoism and are reluctant to accept it again. Second, while Maoism sought to get to power from revolution, the former UML has sought to get to power through multi-party electoral competition. The third is their current political culture. “NCP will not tilt towards China. We are too open,” says Surendra Pandey. “The symposium is an issue related solely to the party school and not to the party as a whole.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn recent months, the US has been trying to intensify cooperative relations with Nepal and its security forces and has conducted a series of diplomatic initiatives to promote the neutrality of the Indo-Pacific Strategy as a policy. Party insiders say that the US, in recent months, has tried to court influential leaders like Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Bishnu Paudel. But while China has made inroads, US diplomacy has suffered several setbacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Home Minister canceled the US National Guards exercise with the Armed Police Force. The Nepal Army objected to the defense force trying to partner with the armed police force in Nepal. It would constitute a major setback for US Department of Defense’s efforts to expand its influence in the Nepali security forces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal Army has adopted a policy of conducting foreign relations through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Now all foreign governments, intergovernmental agencies, and I/NGOs are required to go through the Foreign Ministry. This move has also made the US government unhappy as senior government officials and political appointees close to Oli have been showing reluctance to meet with the Americans. The Nepal Army’s policy is to continue bilateral engagements, but not become part of any multilateral arrangements or exercises, particularly after the bitter experience with BIMSTEC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithin the ruling party, the recent debate over Nepal’s involvement in the Indo-Pacific Strategy has created deep polarization. Leaders close to Dahal protested the framework around MCC as being closely linked to the Indo-Pacific strategy while those close to Oli accuse the latter of being an obstruction against own party. Dev Gurung, the NCP’s Whip, suggested a fresh round of negotiations between the US and Nepal to clarify if this agreement would bring the added pressure of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. The US was not happy with Pampha Bhusal’s statement in the parliament that Nepal should cancel all exercises with the US. She is embittered because the US rejected her a visa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen on September 12, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a press statement regarding Minister Wang Yi’s exchanges with NCP co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal on September 10. The press statement reported Dahal as saying that “Nepal firmly adheres to the policy of non-alignment, disagrees with the so-called Indo-Pacific Strategy, and opposes any attempt to contain or thwart China’s development.”[17] Senior party official associated with the foreign affairs department believes that China deliberately exposed Dahal’s personal conversations with the Chinese Prime Minister Wang Yi. “Dahal did not expect the Chinese to expose his conversation and he was later complaining in a meeting,” a senior party official present at the meeting said. US Embassy Spokesperson Andie De Arment said, “If true, it is bewildering that we now learn about Nepal’s positions from statements issued from Beijing.”[18] Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s spokesperson clarified that Dahal was misquoted and that he had only told Yi that Nepal disapproved of any initiative targeted at China. Nepal will not be part of any strategy that targets China or any other country as it would violate its non-interference clause under non-alignment[19].<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClinton Brown, the spokesperson at the US embassy clarified that there has been a misunderstanding that the Indo-Pacific is similar to a military alliance. Emphasizing that US intentions in Nepal have been selfless and development oriented, Brown stated that the US intents were clear on free and independent Indo-Pacific.[20] Despite persistent efforts by the US to portray Indo-Pacific Strategy as a policy and not a security strategy, stakeholders in Nepal have refused to accept the American interpretation. They say they know the rationale behind the Indo-Pacific strategy and what it entails. The army, however, says it has not faced any direct pressure from China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s inability to deal with neutrality and diplomatic dexterity may have consequences on key agreements and projects that are ongoing including the Millennium Challenge Cooperation. MCC, a grant by the US is a multi-billion dollar investment project in the infrastructure sectors of Nepal. The endorsement of the agreement would have pushed the 400-KV Butwal-Gorakhpur Electricity Transmission Line project ahead. Creating such hurdles in the path of development works would be a deterrence to Nepal’s aspiration of prosperity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMalaysia Migration to Resume<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMigration to Malaysia that was on hold since 2018 is likely to resume as Nepal and Malaysia have agreed to do so at the end of a two-day meeting in Kuala Lumpur on September 12. Nepal had halted issuing work permits to Nepalis going to work in Malaysia since May 2018 objecting to high fees charged by Malaysian sub-contractor for visa processing and cheating poor Nepali workers.[21]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs per the agreement, 86 additional Nepali health centers will be allowed to conduct the pre-departure health check compared to only one center in the past. Nepal has also withdrawn its demand for not using any subcontractors in the visa process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn November 2013, Malaysia had outsourced visa processing to VLN Nepal, a subcontractor, and hiked the visa fees. The embassy later subcontracted elements of the visa process to three more companies, to collect biometrics, stamp holograms, and carry out checks on applicants. All this raised the fee Nepali workers had to pay to Rs 18,480.[22] Nepal had adopted a ‘free visa, free ticket’ policy in 2015 and had shifted this burden to the employers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nViolence, Rule of Law, and Inclusion<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal celebrated the Constitution Day on September 20. The constitution of Nepal is considered as the most progressive one. This constitution has guaranteed the rights of women as a fundamental right. The fundamental rights are the human rights of all citizens which are recognized by the Supreme Court as requiring protection from the government encroachment.[23]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe trafficking of women for the sex trade and entertainment industry has become major threat for decades. A new phenomenon has emerged in recent years. Earlier, women and girls were sold to India for the sex trade, but due to the result of now-defunct one-child policy in China, Nepali women and girls are now being trafficked as brides to China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, it came to light that Indian girls are also being trafficked to Nepal for commercial sex. On this backdrop, the government will have to redefine the way it deals with trafficking.[24]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA report entitled ‘Human Rights of Rape Victims and Police Accountability to their Access to Justice ‘of the National Human Rights Commission revealed that a total of 1,313 rape cases were filed in the first seven months of fiscal 2018-19.[25] Minors are reported to be more vulnerable to rape. The government has failed to identify the perpetrator/s of rape and murder of the infamous Nirmala Pant case. The culprits are getting political protection. The government has done nothing much, rather than being ritualistic in forming several committees to inv estigate the case.[26] Nirmala still waits for justice<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn another incident of demonstration rule of law situation of the country, Naresh Thapa, Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa’s brother, was arrested for his alleged ties to a criminal group. Thapa was arrested after the preliminary police investigation linking him to an extortion racket. Naresh, who is a retired Indian Army, has been released on bail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd again, despite the target set, much action remains undone as cases of maternal mortality is on the rise. Women from the rural areas of Sudur Paschim and Karnali provinces have been facing higher risk due to the geographical remoteness and poverty. The constitution has ensured the right to reproductive health in its fundamental rights. Lack of affordable and accessible health care services and awareness are pushing more and more women of remote areas to lose their lives from complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The government seems to be more focused on infrastructure development rather than human security in those regions. The government is yet to acknowledge that the enhancement of human living standards is also a key indicator of prosperity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an exemplification that women are not equal to men, the ongoing citizenship debate is evidence of systemic and structural barriers in ensuring equal civil rights to women. The unequal treatment between Nepali men and women marrying foreign spouses treated Nepali women as second class citizens limiting their rights.[27] The other incidents like acid attack, cyber-crimes, and sexual harassment in various forms are comparatively new avenues for exploitation of rights of women.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHence, there are several forms of violation of the rights of women, which disrespect the core principle of the constitution, which is to live a life with dignity, freedom, and equality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMental Health<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world health organization defines health as mental, social, and emotional well-being. However, Nepal is yet to mainstream mental health on holistic health promotion. As per the report of Nepal Police, as many as 5,785 people committed suicide in the fiscal year 2018/19. The report indicates that the suicides were committed over family disputes, poverty, misuse of social media, and relationship breakups.[28] Poverty and unemployment are also a few of the major causes of depression which leads to suicide. Many youths are becoming prey to mental health problems due to a lack of employment opportunities within the country and are seeking employment abroad. All the socio-economic, cultural, and political aspects contribute to mental health problems. However, people usually neglect mental health conditions as it is associated with stigma. Availability and accessibility of mental health services are also one of the major challenges to overcome for Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince there was not so much research done on the relationship between suicide and mental disorders in Nepal, it is difficult to find out the effective and appropriate intervention. Hence, by conducting an effective study on suicide and mental health, appropriate measures should be taken to reduce it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDengue<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince August 17, over 5,000 people have been diagnosed with dengue, out of which seven people have lost their lives.[29] Health Minister Upendra Yadav has been criticized for frequent traveling to foreign countries when the country was facing a national emergency. Nepali Congress leader Ram Chandra Paudel accused the government of doing nothing to combat the dengue outbreak.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough dengue becomes an epidemic, the government didn’t come up with long-term and short-term plans. Thousands of people suffered from the disease, the hospitals were overcrowded by patients, but the government didn’t pay much attention to the health and well being of people. The Health Minister’s light statement that the mortality rate was not high and his frequent foreign visit during the health crisis in the country show the high negligence of the government towards citizens’ health. It is not the first time Nepal faced the dengue outbreak. Every year, the range and number of infected people are increasing, but lack of preparedness and effective measures to deal with it has increased the number of infected people this year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are three tiers of government; people have chosen their representative for the enhancement of their well beings. However, the health needs of the people couldn’t be the priorities of any government. The government failed to implement effective plans to control the disease and still it couldn’t be controlled completely. The federal government should have coordinated with the provincial and local authorities to tackle the diseases.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671344874_tibet-3450337_1280-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2019-09', '2019-10-17', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:12:54', '2022-12-18 18:12:54'),

The lockdown in Nepal had forced many out of business and employment in 2020.', NULL, '<p>The world economy hit a recession during the pandemic COVID-19. The lockdown in Nepal had forced many out of business and employment in 2020. According to official estimates and economists, it will take while before Nepal reaches its pre-pandemic economic stage. Shankar Sharma, the former vice-chairperson of the National Planning Commission, added that “the pandemic has derailed the growth target of two fiscal years of 2019-20 and 2020-21”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government’s target was to achieve 8.5% economic growth in 2019-2020, but the Central Bureau of Statistics predicted that the growth in 2019-20 must have slipped to 2.7%. On the other hand, the National Commission claimed that the recorded growth could be merely 0.6%. The World Bank’s reports were even more severe, asserting that Nepal’s growth rate was just 0.2%. The authorities are still in the process of determining the exact growth rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In mid-December, the Ministry of Finance analysed the country’s economic status and found that the government is improving its spending capacity and revenue collection. The figures from the first five years in the fiscal year 2020 weren’t as high as the figures during the same period in the previous year. But the government is satisfied with the 2020 figures under the current circumstances. During the first five months, the government spent Rs 328.45 billion and collected Rs 301.29 billion in revenues. The ministry said that it collected 96.18% of the estimated customs charges, 87.77% of estimated income tax, and 82.03% of estimated excise duties. Moreover, during the year, the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) commitment increased by 31%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the figures are impressive, given the pandemic, the number of new firms registering have dropped by a whopping 45% since the mid of 2020. The officials further added that though COVID-19 was the primary reason behind the drop, political instability significantly contributed to this. The ‘Doing Business’ report for Nepal has frequently reasoned that the investments are limited due to the unfavourable political climate. One hundred three new firms were registered during this period who have collectively committed to employing 6,288 people. The analysts are, however, optimistic about receiving investments in the current year, 2021, since the vaccination drive has begun across the country, which is expected to boost the confidence of the investors. With the ongoing political scenario, the analysts are still observing how the political events unfold, before forecasting any economic element. According to the current statistics, the industries operational are only running at 54% of their capacity due to decreased demands. The chamber of commerce made suggestions to the government to attract investment and demand, but no initiative has been taken yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the worst hit industries during the COVID-19 was undoubtedly the tourism industry. Even though business and operations in most of Nepal have started, the hospitality industry remains distressed. The overall growth outlook is not very optimistic for 2021 since few industries that contribute heavily to the GDP remain hit. There is no sign of recovery; especially the tourism industry, which contributes approximately 25% to the GDP. Despite the vaccination campaign, Nepal is not expecting inbound tourists this year as well. The salary remains cut for those working in this sector, and the cut is valid till the end of the year 2021. However, this pact will be void if the tourism industry picks up in the upcoming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, hotels and restaurants in Pokhara and Chitwan have survived the pandemic due to increased domestic tourism, but the same cannot be said for Kathmandu where locals do not prefer dine-ins and stay in the capital city itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Panel of Tourism Experts of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation has anticipated that the recovery in global tourism will begin in the third quarter of 2021. But roughly one in five panelists believes the recovery won’t start before 2022.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to analysts, large-scale travel restrictions worldwide primarily attribute to the delayed recovery for the sector. Other reasons, such as lower confidence amongst the people and the virus’s fear, also affect tourism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, the struggle of the aviation industry also continues. The cheap tickets and numerous attraction sights always kept the domestic airlines high in the sky. However, the virus has managed to wipe out more than 50% of the domestic passenger traffic. According to the Tribhuvan International Airport statistics, over Rs 5 billion was lost in passenger revenue this year, compared to the previous year. As the number of passengers plummeted by approximately 54%, the number of flight landing and take-off also reduced by 58%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an attempt to attract fliers, the domestic airlines are charging a bare minimum currently. The airline’s authorities claim that this is a ‘survival strategy’ and the cost doesn’t even cover the fuel charges. They only hope that the passengers will soon return. Nevertheless, domestic traffic is much better than the international airlines’ traffic. The festival season followed by the wedding season helped the domestic airlines in filling up their seats. However, with the winter season, the traffic had again dropped due to a high number of flight cancellations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, even though few industries are picking up now, the tourism industry remains shattered with an unforeseeable future. Furthermore, the domestic and foreign investment is expected to increase this year as the investors’ confidence is likely to boost given the vaccination drive; political instability can still hamper the situation.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671344953_KK_Beni_0022-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-03-01', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:14:13', '2022-12-18 18:14:13'),

The news came amidst Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali’s high level visit to New Delhi. All eyes were on Gyawali as it was his ﬁrst visit to New Delhi in over a year and after the boundary row in May. However, any prospects of boundary talks were scrapped after the spokesperson of India’s Ministry of External Affairs made a statement reiterating India’s “well known position”. However, the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines was also high on the agenda of the Gyawali’s visit to which sources disclosed that India expressed its commitment. Experts analyzed that the Foreign Minister’s first high level visit to New Delhi in over a year was not only a major upset for the Oli government but also indicated bilateral ties hitting rock bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to reports, the government of Nepal is considering signing an agreement on procuring vaccines manufactured in India to vaccinate 52% of Nepal’s population. Soon after, the Ministry of External Affairs of India also confirmed that Nepal is on the list of countries that it will start supplying the vaccines beginning January 20. However, experts have said that Nepal should not rely so heavily on one country and should consider diversifying its sources. They argue that any country manufacturing vaccines will only cater to other countries after they have enough doses to vaccinate their own population. Although the Government of Nepal had sent diplomatic notes to other countries producing COVID-19 vaccines such as China, Russia, USA, and the UK, India has been given priority bearing in mind logistics, pricing, and India’s commitment to facilitate the procurement process. According to the Health Ministry, the World Health Organization (WHO) will also provide vaccines for three percent of the population by the end of April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The news of the arrival of vaccines in Nepal has been promising but experts have expressed concerns on issues such as transportation, storage, surveillance, distribution, etc. Over the past year, the government has been criticized for fumbling Nepal’s efforts to contain the virus as a result of poor coordination among the three tiers. Public health experts have said that the existing vaccine distribution systems are not designed for large scale vaccination programs and require the support of strong oversight mechanisms. Therefore, the role of the three tiers of government will be crucial in determining the success of the vaccination drive and the lack of strategy can create unforeseen issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal kicked off the first phase of the nationwide COVID-19 immunization drive from January 27 using a portion of the 1 million doses of vaccines provided by India under grant assistance. According to reports, the Health Ministry prepared a list of 430,000 front liners including health workers, supporting staffers at health facilities, female community health volunteers, security personnel, sanitation workers, elderly people living in care homes, and prisoners who will start getting inoculated in 65 districts across the country. According to reports, Nepal is set to buy 4 million Covishield vaccines in the second phase of its inoculation drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another challenge facing Nepal is the lack of trust in the vaccines procured. Frontline workers have expressed doubts about the efficacy of the Covishield vaccines. Health experts say that since COVID-19 vaccines were developed unconventionally and under a short period of time, misinformation and rumors have eroded public confidence in the vaccines. However, the WHO has stated that “it is important to build trust in the COVID-19 vaccines before people form an opinion against them”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The confirmation of the new and faster spreading COVID-19 variant first identified in the UK, has arisen as yet another challenge in Nepal’s fight against COVID-19. Speculations began when three individuals who arrived from the UK, tested positive for COVID-19. Their swab samples were sent to the WHO’s collaborating center in Hong Kong which determined that all three returnees were infected with the new variant. The Health Ministry said that “the incident shows that the risk of infections are not over and people should continue to follow safety protocols”. As of February 3, the virus has claimed 2030 lives and infected 271,289 people in the country. While COVID-19 vaccines have reached Nepal just a year after the first case was identiﬁed in the country, if the government’s handling of the pandemic thus far is any indication, the vaccination campaign is likely to be riddled with challenges.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671345077_JS-Lamjung-CovidBirudhakokhop-1-1536x1152.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-02-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:16:17', '2022-12-18 18:16:17');

Has Nepal moved forward since? Is the Prime Minister doing anything to keep his words or was it merely an act of securing votes? Will Nepal attract business and investments from foreign countries?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the last thirty years, before the electoral success of NCP, Nepali Congress was in office. The public entrusted their hopes in the Congress. However, the recent fall of Congress implies that the public lost confidence in the party due to low delivery and lack of pronounced outcome. Following Congress, even the leader of the left party has proved to be a man solely of words. This is hampering the political vision of the general public who have little hope from the government. If this scenario continues, it will bring political instability in the country with the general public having no faith in any major party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the end of the decade, Nepal has shown no substantial progress under the leadership of Oli. The Prime Minster gave hope to the citizens which is now shattering. He spoke about making this country strong in order to face challenges and boost confidence. But these were again simply words. No significant action has been taken to ensure the prosperity of Nepal or the happiness of Nepalis. After doing the Business Rating, the environment was projected to be conducive but the incremental business on the grounds will testify its validity in the decade that has just started. In other words, quite the opposite was witnessed in the last month of the decade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMCC Grants could be a game changer if the country accepts the additional financial support from United States, keeping the differences apart. The political leaders should realize that Nepal is not responsible for pleasing any country. It should act on the basis of its own best interest. USD 500 million is nearly adding 12% to the assigned Capital Budget of USD 4 billion. It will be unwise for the country to turn down such a huge grant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the Visit Nepal 2020 scheme, Nepal is targeting two million tourists this year. Chinese tourists are the major target group. The Chinese ambassador to Nepal shared her pictures in order to promote Nepali tourism. However, no meaningful step was taken by the Chinese viz. increasing number of flights to and from China by allowing Nepal Airlines Corporation to operate. Currently, there are 98 flights per week but allowing NAC to fly to Chinese airspace will also increase the number of tourists. In addition, Nepal-China has proved to be a lucrative route and will further improve NAC’s revenue by many folds. If NAC fails to operate on these routes, it will never be a revenue-generating corporation. This will further hurt the country’s economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere has also been no advancement in Belt and Road Initiative. The Chinese intent seems to be narcissistic. The northern neighbour recently proposed an extradition treaty which is against the International Human Rights Law. When that treaty couldn’t be signed, they proposed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) which further makes the Tibetan refugees vulnerable in Nepal. Succumbing to the pressure from China, Nepal is doing little to protect the rights of the refugees. The arrest of 122 Chinese nationals under no strong charges was an abuse of power from China. Their interests are purely vested and will definitely not benefit Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe above mentioned cases clearly shows digression, not progression to reach for a Prosperous Nepal, leaving the citizens displeased, and amusingly, the motive of the government appears unclear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government has also left no stone unturned to provoke the public.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a bid to squeeze civil space and curtail democracy, the Oli government has been vigorously working to consolidate its power, be it by banning public spaces or by introducing different Bills in the parliament. The proposed IT Bill is to further this agenda of the government. It is antithetical to the people’s aspiration from the Federal Democratic Republic. The enactment of the bills alone will cause a severe blow to Nepal’s infant democracy, as two vital components of it—freedom of expression and the right to privacy—will suffer unfortunate compromise. A few incidents are like that of Pashupati Shama, whose YouTube page was brought down because he voiced against corruption and bribery;[1] Pranesh Gautam was arrested on grounds of criticizing a movie;[2] singer Durgesh Thapa was detained on grounds of hurting religious sentiments in his song, ‘Happy Tihar, Chiso Beer’;[3] rapper VTEN was arrested because of supposedly promoting anti-social values.[4] These are just a few examples of restraining the right of expression. Now the government is trying to control the online content through the means of the constitution. Any anti-government expression will be a criminal activity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, nexus of contractors and politicians focus more on making profits rather than keeping the public contended. The change in rule of the games, in particular the Public Procurement Act was to fulfil the interests of the politicians who are wealth and power hungry. The frequent amendments in the Public Procurement Act raised speculations about the objective of the government. All the projects will now remain incomplete without any threat or fine. This will crush the dream of the general public and also increase subsequent pollution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe seat of the Speaker at the House of Representative still remains vacant. It seems the government does not want to hand over the Speaker’s position to Deputy Speaker Tumbahamphe because she is a woman. Is the government only responsible for the happiness of men? Gender insensitivity and patriarchal mind set needs a transformation. The gender gap in mainstream politics only keeps widening and most of the women in politics are widows of their late politician husbands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n‘Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali’ agenda of the incumbent government will turn out to be just a populist slogan with no real delivery. Nepal currently ranks 42nd [5] in the happy planet index and isn’t expected to improve in the upcoming years. This is not impressive for a developing country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMCC and IPS Conundrum<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal seems to be a strategic battleground in the making for global superpowers, particularly the US, China, and India. The split in the opinion for and against MCC at the recent Nepal Communist Party Standing Committee meeting is a manifestation of influence of both the West and China, showcasing their success in creating loyal lobbies in the ruling NCP and other large parties alike. The interest groups have their vested interests above national necessity of infrastructure development in realizing Prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepali.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Standing Committee meeting of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, which ended on December 22, did not ratify the MCC.[6] Participants opined that Nepal should not accept MCC if it is part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy promoted by the US, ostensibly, to counter the increasing influence of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The argument from the faction in opposition is that the Indo-Pacific Strategy is deemed a key instrument now to further the geostrategic influence of the US in the region, and Nepal should not be part of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and the MCC entered into an agreement in 2017 to implement the USD 500 million contract for the development of roads and cross-border transmission lines. US President Donald Trump then coined the term ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’ (IPS) towards the end of 2017, after the pact was signed. IPS works for free and open Indo-Pacific region, operating under rules-based international order. The IPS has military-defence, governance, and economics as the three pillars. Whereas MCC is an independent US foreign assistance agency established in 2004.[7]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal has already declared the transmission line project as a national pride project, reached Project Implementation Agreement and established Electricity Regulatory Commission as per the demands of the US. Nepal is yet to ratify the agreement through the parliament and also reach an agreement with India for the Butwal-Gorakhpur cross-border transmission line.[8] However, division in the ruling party over accepting the grant under the MCC, if it is part of IPS, the major infrastructure projects under it has fallen in limbo.[9]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe IPS controversy has the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) divided over accepting the US Aid under the MCC. Some leaders are of the view that Nepal should not accept MCC Grant as it is a part of the IPS, while FM Gyawali reiterates that the grant has no links with the strategy. The United States, time and again, has made it clear that the MCC is a part of the IPS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNCP Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal hinted at prolonging the parliamentary endorsement process for the MCC grant if it is part of the IPS. Dahal said the row over whether the MCC is just an US government aid or is part of an Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) should be settled before endorsement by the parliament.[10] Contrary to Dahal’s remarks, Minister for Information, Communication, and Technology, Gokul Prasad Baskota remarked that the US offer will be endorsed in the parliament soon.[11]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s position to accept the MCC, despite it being a part of the IPS, as the electricity and road projects are vital for our development and saying that we are not part of IPS is illogical.[12] The Americans have officially said that MCC is a part of the IPS while Nepal government says it is not. The US has the right to decide how to classify the money they provide us as grant. Nepal has the choice of accepting or rejecting the offer. Obviously, Nepal needs huge investments for transmission lines and road connectivity. Nepal has to accept support from all and cannot turn down offers like both the MCC and BRI. It cannot accept one and reject other to please either the US or China. Nepal needs to strike a balance, centred on national interest and recalibration of our foreign policy and institutionalization of the same. Foreign policy is a part of the national development strategy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNAC Planes from “Hi Fly” Yet to Fly High in China<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s northern neighbour China is flying to Nepal frequently i.e., 98 flights a week after the recent increase from 70 flights per week. Amongst these is a Nepal-based private carrier, Himalaya Airlines which started operations to Beijing on October 27, 2019.[13] However, no slot or permission has been given to Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) to fly even a single flight to the northern neighbour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) and European Union’s ban on NAC citing safety and structural issues, China had also banned the national carrier from flying to the country. The primary argument is that the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) is both a regulator and an operator, because it also manages Nepal’s airports. Despite ICAO lifting its ban on Nepal Airlines in 2017,[14] the EU officials stated the prerequisite to remove the ban from Nepali Airlines was to split up the Civil Aviation Authority into two entities.[15]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe CAAN authorities also claimed that all the aircrafts in the fleet were three decades old and NAC appeared ignorant about safety audits. In 2015, NAC added four new Airbuses to its fleet, two wide and two narrow bodied.[16]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo lift Nepal Airlines from the debt burden, the executive director of NAC, Madan Kharel was forced to present a business plan to PM Oli. He contemplated to bring in a strategic international partner but argued that it would take too long. In 2016, Lufthansa was selected as a strategic partner, but the Finance Ministry sank the deal. Kharel submitted his breakeven plan to the ministry, which includes commencing flights to Osaka, Riyadh, and Guangzhou, and increasing the fleet utilisation.[17]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuresha Acharya, Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, agrees that things must change, “The government has two options: either invest in shares, or invite foreign investment. But with the corporation’s financial situation is so dire that it is unlikely any foreign partners will be interested.”[18]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith Nepal’s upcoming Visit Nepal 2020 project, it is said that China is the most lucrative tourist market for Nepal. Since 2015, NAC has been pestering Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) to allow operations to China and asked the Nepali government to interfere on its behalf.[19] CAAC earlier issued a notice to NAC that following a safety audit by the Chinese officials, the carrier could operate direct flights to 15 destinations in China. The audit was slated for September, but then pushed to October and again to November. It was again postponed by a month to December.[20] CAAC was avoiding the inevitable: security audit for Nepal Airlines. The flights were scheduled to begin in January which was pushed to March due to delay in auditing. NAC’s permission is critical to increased revenue and tourist footfall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmidst all the chaos regarding delayed audit, on December 4, under the Foreign Commercial Air Transport Operators Operational Approval Rules (CCAR-129), CAAC sent an official letter to NAC allowing it to operate flights to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. CAAC withdrew its decision to conduct the audit and the flights are likely to begin in February.[21] However, within two weeks of the notice, NAC extended this timeline stating the carrier will fly to Guangzhou from second week of March.[22] While the benefits are obvious, Nepal’s delay in gaining slots for Nepal Airlines in China is an indicator of things that are wrong with Nepal’s diplomacy. Based on the recently revised air services agreement between Nepal and China, the national flag carrier will operate three flights a week to Guangzhou.[23]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, NAC is also conducting a study to operate commercial flights to Dhaka in Bangladesh; Yangon in Myanmar; Hanoi in Vietnam; Phnom Penh in Cambodia, and Colombo in Sri Lanka.[24]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNAC is giving the impression that it is desperate to improve the financial situation as it also urged support from the government. It has not been in the best shape following the radical purchase of four airbuses and were to propose a plan to Oli. NAC needs to be able to operate long haul flights and meet its full potential.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArrest of 122 Chinese in Kathmandu<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn December 2019, 122 Chinese nationals were arrested by the Nepal Police citing illegal activities. The nature of these crimes was not certain, if any. This was the biggest single day arrest of individuals from any foreign country in Nepal. The police claimed the arrest was made as per the request of Interpol. A day after the arrest, the officials said that they were looking for evidence of any such criminal activity on Nepalese soil. Beijing said that it was a joint effort from Nepal and China Police, which the Nepal Police denied.[25]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe arrested nationals were suspected of being involved in cross border frauds and also ATM hacking in Nepal. According to Nepali officials, some may have been staying illegally or doing business in Nepal despite holding tourist visa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“If they are found to be involved in any illegal activity in Nepal, they will be charged as per the law of the land,” said Chief of the Kathmandu Metropolitan Police Range. “If they have not committed any crime in Nepal, we will inform the government. The government will most likely deport them.”[26] As per the pact, Nepal will hand over Chinese nationals to the Chinese authorities if they have breached Nepali laws like overstaying or doing business while on a tourist visa but have not committed any crime in Nepali land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe police were holding the Chinese without filing proper charges. This raised suspicion regarding the Chinese in police custody without prior investigation.[27] This is another example of breaching human rights. The only charge under which the police was holding these citizens is ‘indecent behaviour’. Nepal follows the idea of habeas corpus under which no person can be detained without concrete charges. However, it seems like Nepal police are bending some rules for the Chinese. This has left room for misinterpretation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver conducting a week-long investigation, the Police failed to establish charges. The Chinese were given bail at the cost of NRS 1000 by the District Administration Office.[28] They were accused of online gambling, financial fraud, cybercrime and violating visa norms. However, no evidence was found. Only 67 passports were recovered from the 122 nationals. The travel documents for the rest are being arranged to be deported to China.[29]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring Xi Jinping’s visit to Kathmandu in 2019, there were debates on signing an extradition treaty. Extradition treaties are often a legitimate tool of international law enforcement. But sending people to a country where they are at risk of serious human rights abuses is a breach of international human rights law. Nepal is also bound by the principle of non-refoulement, which means refugees must not be sent back to countries where they face prosecution. The country is home to 20,000 Tibetan refugees some of who may not have been granted the refugee status and makes them vulnerable. As observed, Nepal’s willingness to defend Tibetan rights has shrunk under Chinese pressure.[30]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the treaty never got approval since it would have sparked retaliation. Later, amongst the 21 treaties that were signed, one was the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).[31] This treaty is based on the Mutual Legal Assistance Act 2014. As per Section 5 of Nepal’s Mutual Legal Assistance Act, mutual legal assistance between Nepal and a foreign state may be provided in following matters related to judicial proceedings: (a) taking, collecting, or receiving document or evidence; (b) providing information and evidence by inspecting any relevant thing or place; (c) providing originals or certified copies of relevant documents including banking, financial, or business records; (d) executing searches and seizures of objects, locating, or identifying persons; (e) facilitating the appearance of persons who can assist in a matter of criminal nature; (f) serving summons; (g) freezing or confiscating movable or immovable property and, (h) enforcing judgments.[32]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the signing of MLAT, Chinese can extradite their nationals from Nepal if found guilty. Usually, someone who overstays their Nepali tourist visa is required to pay a fine and arrests rarely occur. But such a loosely worded pact can mean any Chinese national wanted by China and residing in Nepal can be sent back on as small a charge as overstaying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe question arises whether Nepal will do the same with or for India. Due to multiple open borders with India, it is of importance to sign the MLAT or extradition treaty with the southern neighbour. People commit crime in Nepal and run off to India. It appears that the Nepal government succumbed to the pressure from Northern neighbour while violating human rights and habeas corpus. Why was China given the privilege? The arrest caused conjecture. It seems like Nepal will cross any limit to maintain ‘good’ relations with the northern neighbour. During Xi’s visit, Nepali nationals as young as 14 were arrested and held for sporting Free Tibet merchandise, showing Nepal’s growing intolerance.[33] It appears that this treaty can be misused by the Chinese in order to bring back the Tibetan refugees who faced persecution in China. Who can guarantee that the MLAT won’t be used against them? As a member of the United Nations, this is a clear violation of International Human Rights Law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFreedom in Chains<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the Oli government that has been vigorously working to curtail democracy and consolidate its power, December proved to be a particularly busy month. On December 29, the Development and Technology Committee of the parliament endorsed a controversial IT Bill that was registered in the Parliament in February 2019.[34] On the following day, December 30, another highly controversial Special Service Bill was registered in the federal parliament. The enactment of these two bills alone will cause a severe blow to Nepal’s infant democracy, as two vital components of it—freedom of expression and the right to privacy—will suffer unfortunate compromise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s Information Technology and electronic activities are conducted under the overarching Electronic Transaction Act (ETA), which will be replaced by the new IT Bill after it is endorsed by the full House. The Bill, however, has some major issues capable of jeopardizing Nepal’s democracy and human rights, which only exposes the government’s authoritarian tendencies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bill has a “provision of a fine not exceeding Rs 1.5 million or a jail term not exceeding five years, or both,”[35] for posting any content that may be classified as an act of “cyber-terrorism.” Similarly, a person found guilty “cyberbullying” maybe subjected to “a fine of up to Rs 50,000 or six-month jail term, or both.”[36] The terms “cyberbullying” and “cyber-terrorism,” however, are so vaguely defined in the Sections 83 and 84 of the Bill that analysts claim it will cause grave misuse and misinterpretation of the provision and curb Nepali citizens’ freedom of expression ensured by the Constitution. The Bill states, “By using any electronic system, no one should continuously bully, tease, degrade, discourage, disrespect, and scold at any person or commit any act similar to them,”[37] which has to be interpreted as “cyberbullying.” Similarly, on the account of “cyber-terrorism” or crime against the state. The Bill reads, “By using an electronic system, no one should commit or perform any action that would jeopardise Nepal’s national security, sovereignty, territorial integrity, nationality or national unity, independence, self-dignity or harmonious relations between federal units or anything that would obstruct or cause an adverse impact on the country’s security or data system.”[38]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst of all, the mere vagueness of the terms poses a big threat to Nepal’s democracy, as it allow the authorities a great deal of flexibility and ease to frame an online activity as an act of cyberbullying or cyber-terrorism. This authority, along with the fear of a hefty fine or jail-term, will significantly restrain people’s freedom of expression online. Political analysts and human rights activists, therefore, have criticized the Bill and have accused the government “of terrorizing the people…to stop criticisms against the government in the social media.”[39]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond, the Bill has a provision that requires Social Networking Sites operating in Nepal, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Viber, to be registered inside the country,[40] which means that the government can conveniently ban any to all the social media sites if they fail to register here. For a country with a comparatively smaller population, and hence a not-so-big market, it is worth wondering whether the tech giants will be willing to undergo the bureaucratic hassle and financial burden associated with registering their companies in Nepal. If not, the Nepali people will face the fate of the Chinese, who are deprived of social media sites and the freedom to express their voices online, which is what the Oli government seems to want.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThird, with a huge burden on the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to take down websites and contents that violate the new laws, the internet will likely be a heavily censored platform because the ISPs’ topmost priority will be to safeguard their business from government crackdown on them.[41] The quality of internet the Nepali people are enjoying at the moment, therefore, is at a risk too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFourth, there is a major problem regarding the jurisdiction of the proposed offenses. Instead of the existing judicial bodies, the IT bill states that the cases related to it will be decided by a three-membered IT court, to be formed one in each of the seven provinces. Apart from an additional government expenditure, the lack of its independence is a big issue. Because the government will appoint the members of the IT court itself, there is a high risk of the court being impartial in the favor of the government. This arrangement will violate a fundamental principle of democracy that judiciary is an independent constitutional body.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf monetary compensation were to determine the severity of a crime or an action, the government seems to place cyber offense above the heinous act of rape. What is worse is the room for interpretation the Bill allows to the government-dictated IT court. After the law is enacted, a person mocking a senior government official through online memes may have to pay Rs 1.5 million or end up in jail, which basically means that mocking a government official is a more serious offence than any other heinous crimes including rape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother development against democracy is the registration of the Special Service Bill. The Act, if enacted, will authorize the intelligence agencies of the country to “intercept telephonic and digital conversations between individuals.”[42] Defenders of the Bill cite the interference of international agencies such as RAW and CIA as the need for the country’s preparedness through counterintelligence. However, the Act jeopardizes the right of privacy of all individuals, as the government can easily manipulate the law to intrude into anybody’s private affairs. This may include intercepting lawmakers’ or chief justice’s phone calls or online correspondences. That will be a severe compromise of democracy at multiple levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHas there been no resistance against these new Bills? The ruling Communist Party of Nepal seems to have hijacked that privilege too; following the resignation of the former Speaker, Krishna Bahadur Mahara, after rape allegations against him, the post has been vacant, and therefore, the parliamentary process is at rest. The main reason behind the lack of a Speaker since October 1 is the CPN’s intraparty disagreements over the nomination for the post. With no Speaker in the House, the parliament is inactive, and therefore, there is no parliamentary debate on the controversial bills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe controversial IT Bill and Special Service Bill are two gallant examples of NCP’s authoritarian tendencies and its intention to significantly constrain civil liberty. The parliamentary uncertainty seems to be facilitating this process. Therefore, the direction in which the NCP government is headed should alarm all and they need to raise voice against before it is too late.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Players set the Rules<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe eighth amendment in the public procurement act has provisioned bid capacity for contractors disallowing them to bid for new project until they complete the project in hand. The implementation of the provision was expected to press the contractors for timely completion of projects and contribute in delivering progress.[43]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecretary at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers claimed that the amendment would help the government to get rid of problems where contractors bag large size projects but do not perform as per stipulated specification and press them to complete timely as per the agreement.[44] But the act has gone through a ninth amendment in a short while with provisions in favour of contractors. Interestingly, the Act had undergone amendment for 8 times, three consecutive this year alone.[45]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs contractors threatened to halt works, the government secretly amended the Public Procurement Regulation, in favour of corrupt contractors.[46] The amendment relaxed a provision that allow contractors to continue even if 50 per cent of works of a project has not been completed within deadline. Earlier in the sixth amendment, contracts in such case would be automatically cancelled, however.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd again, a ninth amendment has been made recently. The amendment has now a provision to penalize contractors from the day of the contract agreement if the latter fail to complete the projects even in the extended deadline. A provision of penalty while extending the deadline of projects after the contractors’ failure to finish them on time have been removed. Earlier, as per a provision in the eighth amendment, the government could charge up to 10 per cent penalty for extending the deadline. The Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal had expressed reservations against some of the provisions in the eighth amendment. [47] Further a provision in the ninth amendment allows for extension of the deadline further based on cabinet decision too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNotably, seventh amendment to the Public Procurement Act removed a provision that bars companies facing corruption charges from participating in the bidding for public contracts. Earlier, the sixth amendment had introduced a provision to bar the bidders, from participating in bidding process of public contracts until the corruption case against them was cleared.[48]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIronically, as a defiance to fight against corruption, when players set the rules of the game fair play is presumably a far cry. Good governance, transparency, accountability and corruption free society will always remain a dream. Public Procurement Management Office has a mandate to work towards ensuring good governance in public procurement system that is transparent efficient and free of corruption.[49] The Office is placed directly under the prime minister and functions as per the Public Procurement Act, 2063 and Public Procurement Regulation, 2064. But the players set the rules the Prime Minister is a mere statutory figure as it seems or is a proxy of the players, remains a valid question.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671345219_news-feb-1-7-2019-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-09', '2020-09-22', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:18:39', '2022-12-18 18:18:39'),

Improving public health is a key to prepare for epidemics.', NULL, '<p>Summary<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no human control over natural disasters, but there are always small ways to improve the lives of the people affected with those disasters. Improving public health is a key to prepare for epidemics. However, COVID-19, which is turning out to be a pandemic, has unveiled the unpreparedness of Nepali authorities under crisis and the need for government investment in public health and infrastructure. Nepal’s focus has been on corruption scandals ever since KP Oli came to power. Widespread corruption has laid bare the rife financial undercurrents which is the main culprit for the country’s inability in creating development opportunities at home despite huge sums of money being injected into development projects, both from internal and external sources. Unemployment and foreign labor migration are the major challenges in realizing a prosperous Nepal. They are also interconnected with national security.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Nepal’s constitution guarantees right to employment to every citizen in the country, international migration should have been a voluntary choice, however, it remains a necessity for many till date. Ironically, remittance serves one-third of the Gross Domestic Product in Nepal. Despite its huge contribution to the national economy, foreign labor migration is a very challenging phenomenon as it is associated with socio-economic, legal, political, and health hazards. The migrant workers often engage in dirty, dangerous, and difficult work threatening their lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverlooking the sufferings in the destination countries, people are forced to migrate for employment. The Prime Minister Employment Programme, which was designed to address the domestic unemployment problem, has not been successful in ensuring the rights to employment as provisioned in Nepal’s Constitution. Minister for Labour, Employment, and Security Rameshwar Raya Yadav had vowed that the government would provide jobs to 60,000 youths under PMEP this fiscal. However, the project is yet to take off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPM Oli has time and again stated that the government would adopt a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and that he himself is strictly against corruption and would not let anyone else indulge in it. As the Prime Minister states that the government is actively working to curb corruption, various individuals from his own party have been caught in corruption scandals repeatedly in a matter of two years that he has taken office. Whether it be Bishnu Poudel from NCP for ‘Lalita Niwas land grab scam’, Raghubir Mahaseth, Minister for Infrastructure and Transportation, or the freshly reported Gokul Banskota case, it can be surmised that the KP Oli administration is not seen doing much to restrain the corruption culture in the government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe corruption scandal of Gokul Prasad Baskota, PM’s Oli’s confidante, has weakened Oli’s position in the party. On the contrary, Dahal’s seeming distance from the corruption scandal, evidenced by his remarks, his uncensored criticism of the government’s performance, and his apparent dissatisfaction with the status of NCP’s unification have strengthened his position in the party.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the infamous rape case on former Speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara, a few high profile rape cases have come to light. The perpetrators are the high-level officials of a security agency. In most of the cases, it has been found out that the perpetrators are comparatively powerful and ‘well-connected’ than survivors. In these politically high-profile cases, legal support, rehabilitation, and the process of justice to the survivors are also politicized. Inevitably, victim blaming, negligence from law enforcement bodies, lack of support from family and society, all play roles to create obstacles in the process of justice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe PM’s commitment to curbing corruption is seemingly turning out to be a lie while the rule of law and fundamental constitutional rights including employment and another dimension of human security draws no concern of the government. Likewise, on the Corona disaster, the government is all but unprepared.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApart from the Corona impact on the global economy, the sluggish Indian economy may slow down Nepal’s growth. The Indian budget decides the price and availability of the consumer goods for Nepal. Since a lot of consumer goods imported from India are sourced from the market of the bordering towns of India, Indian taxes and duties are included in the price. So, Nepalis end up paying Indian taxes too. Additionally, Nepal may follow the new income tax slabs introduced by India in the budget this year. As a smaller economy that is intricately connected with the Indian economy, over-dependence exposes Nepal to anomalies. Rampant excavation of Natural resources ongoing across country as per the decision of local governments has threatened people’s livelihoods, their place and culture. All three tiers of the FDR seem to be contesting just in taking benefits from the natural resources but have remained irresponsible towards conservation. National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission has devised a formula for sharing the benefits. As per the formula local governments and provinces would get 25% of the revenue collected and the federal government the remaining 50%.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671345524_january-analysis-2-100x151.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-01', '2020-09-28', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:23:44', '2022-12-18 18:23:44'),

Nepal hasn’t remained untouched by the pandemic, and the government hastily announced a nationwide lockdown to stop the virus from spreading. The government, however, seems to consider the basic principles of pandemic control in its strategy to combat the virus. Despite the low number of positive Coronavirus cases in Nepal as of now, experts are concerned over the inevitable occurrence of the pandemic. Looking at the struggle of even the most developed countries to contain it, a critical question on Nepal’s preparedness, governance, and capacity to handle the looming disaster does arise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven issues such as the prime minister’s kidney transplant and the internal bickering within the ruling party, the cabinet should be able to take decisions even in the absence of the Prime Minister. Perhaps, a heavily medicated prime minister is probably not in the right frame of mind to make decisions that are the need of the hour. The appointment of an officiating executive head for the duration that he is incapacitated could have eased governance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey areas to focus<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirstly, the frontline medical professionals should be given enough knowledge on the virus, its pathogenicity and transmission modes. With due consideration of the severity, the government should devise a response to contain infectious diseases. Health workers are always on the frontline during medical emergencies, and they should practice safety measures; for this, the necessary steps and required equipment should be in place for them. Amidst various public health concerns, specialized locations across countries should be prepared to strictly deal with COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Epidemic control, mitigation, and suppression should be the key driver for whatever action the government takes. The learnings from other countries should be adapted to the socio-economic context of the country and implemented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a shock-response measure, safety nets should be ensured for the ones who lost their livelihood during and after the lockdown. Even amidst lockdown, the government should guarantee the unbroken supply chain of the daily essentials for life. And with saving lives, the second agenda of saving the economy should come in once measures are in place to prevent the catastrophe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout a doubt, the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic has created upheavals in the world economy. The impact is disastrous and will not spare Nepal as well. Nepal’s economy will be severely affected by the economic turmoil of neighbouring China and India as it is almost dependent on the Chinese and Indian supply chain. Further, the rise in the price of daily consumable goods along with the depreciating value of Nepali rupees against the USD, the inflation rate will go higher up beyond the government’s target of 6% for the year. Given Nepal’s foreign currency reserves dependency on remittance, a reduction will squeeze the liquidity in the domestic financial market, household economic activities, and international trade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the optimism that the economy will rebound, the virus-driven recession will affect more people economically by either causing them to lose their jobs or making them go bankrupt. Tourism and employment will remain the worst-hit areas for further ahead, even after the pandemic comes to an end causing a greater negative impact on Nepal’s economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen every country is fighting its own battle, Nepal is in it alone for the most part, and people fear this. Nevertheless, as of today, the focus for all countries has been on saving lives at risk, and unquestionably, people are much more important than the economy. Just like most of the people around the globe who are panicking about the destructive pandemic or its looming aftermath, Nepali people are also living under constant fear of what lies ahead, fear of a possible surge in the Coronavirus cases within the country that receives nurture from the globally accelerating crisis, lack of preparedness and confusion amongst all three tiers of government, the executive having a bed rest with frequent hospitalization after second renal transplant, no delegation of authority despite his health conditions, public mistrust of the government, horrid past experiences and uncertainties of the future, and lack of preparedness and capacity to fight the disease. What has further exacerbated this fear is the government’s haphazard, unscientific, and uncalculated decisions; the lockdown and a subsequent shortage of essential goods, for instance, has invited panic, especially in the absence of any government-funded stimulus plans and subsidies for the hardest-hit people, the daily-wage earners, and other vulnerable groups.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt a time when the entire world is battling against a common enemy, Nepali people cannot help but look back at their own experience and gauge how poorly prepared their government is. Nevertheless, along with the extension of the COVID-19 lockdown, the Cabinet meeting on March 30 has announced a relief package to cushion the impact of the disease on the economy. Irrespective of everything that should be done and is being done so far in Nepal, the Virus will be controlled only with patience and disciplined implementation of the lockdown, and life can return to normal.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671354604_january-analysis-2-100x151 (1).jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-02', '2020-09-28', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:26:45', '2022-12-18 20:55:04');

China reacted strongly to the document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US seeks to “maintain US strategic primacy in the Indo-Pacific Region” and “prevent China from establishing new, illiberal spheres of influence.” The document says “a strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a counterbalance to China.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is supporting India’s rise “as a provider of net security and Major Defense Partner” and recognizes its preeminent role in South and Southeast Asia. However, India’s usefulness is seen primarily in reference to countering China’s growing inﬂuence. According to the document, US considers Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka as partners and has sought to work closely with them, particularly because of the significance of maritime security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US relations with Nepali Army will likely be guided by the Framework and will have implications for counterintelligence, cyber security, and management of classified information. Nepali Army will face pressure from US allies, if there is a trend in Nepal to create a Chinese model of government or if the government grows close to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US will likely work with India, Japan, UK and Australia in Nepal to finance projects that enhance regional connectivity with India and Bangladesh. India and the US are tracking Chinese investments and financial interests in Nepal. Nepal’s political parties may see gradual polarization to reflect the cold war between US and China. India’s role and position would be crucial in this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>South Asian regional dynamics</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>US relations with Sri Lanka appeared to have backslid. In December, the US withdrew</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD 480 million MCC grant to Sri Lanka citing lack of “partner country engagement.” It was interpreted by the media as a sign that the US was not happy with growing ties between Sri Lanka and China. Global Times said the US was also trying to pit Nepal and Bangladesh against China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US and the Maldives held the inaugural dialogue on defense and security in January following the framework signed in September last year. According to a US Indo-Pacific Command statement, the framework focuses on four areas: exercises, logistics, information sharing and professional military education. In the latest meet, both sides “reaffirmed their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region and agreed on activities in 2021 that will advance shared priorities such as maritime security, counterterrorism, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vaccine Diplomacy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>China is pushing back against the US and India, who are using COVID-19 investigations and vaccine diplomacy to weaken Chinese interests. Chinese experts are calling for WHO investigations on COVID-19 in the US, expressing concerns about India’s attempts to push its vaccine and contain SinoVac trials in Bangladesh. India provided 600,000 vials of vials produced by Astra Zeneca to Sri Lanka in late January. Global Times claims that India is meddling on China’s efforts to conduct clinical trials in Bangladesh for its SinoVac vaccine. China’s efforts to use vaccine diplomacy has backﬁred globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>US Foreign Policy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Joseph Biden sought to reposition US foreign policy in the global stage by placing human rights and democratic alliances at the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken criticized Russia and said China was the “most signiﬁcant challenge to us of any other country.” His speech indicated that US is counting on stronger alliances and remedying its weaknesses (not pulling back and adopting proper military postures) in order to negotiate with China from a “position of strength.” Blinken also talked about the need to put pressure on China regarding human rights issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his counterparts in Japan, Australia, and India after assuming office and said the US will continue Trump’s Indo Paciﬁc Strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts in the US say, managing Xi Jinping would provide a new test for US, as it poses risks comparable to the Cuban crisis. Views of the US was highlighted by the publication of an anonymous “The Longer Telegram” published by the Atlantic Council, which argues that China led by Xi Jinping is the “single most important challenge facing the United States.” The piece argues that the US should try to create a schism between Xi Jinping (including his inner circle) and China’s ruling elites (Chinese Communist Party).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese experts believe that the US administration has adopted selective multilateralism that will only include “democratic” allies, excluding countries like China.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>China</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A senior Chinese official gave a speech on China-US relations on February 2, which was interpreted as a “pragmatic route map” to fox bilateral relations. Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, oﬀered cooperation on issues of common interest like ﬁght against COVID-19, economic recovery and climate change. While significant differences persist on many issues, including politics, China is offering cooperation on issues like renewable energy and low-carbon technology, sustainable development, military, law enforcement, drug control and cybersecurity, as well as cooperation at the UN, the World Health Organization, the G20, APEC and other multilateral platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese experts feel that the US is meddling on Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the two autonomous regions of Xinjiang and Tibet. Chinese experts, however, are divided as how to perceive the Biden administration. Some perceive a softer stance from the new administration, with any hard position interpreted as an attempt to please the US audience. While others feel that the new administration is not ﬁxing US-China ties but merely “adjusting Trump’s China policy to … better serve the US interests.” Meanwhile, China ﬂew military airplanes over Taiwan Strait in a show of force meant as a message to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China hosted the China Tibet Trans-Himalaya Forum for International Cooperation where it called on the US for multilateralism to address climate-change issues. This was the third forum hosted by the Tibetan government, which is “aiming to facilitate regional connectivity, communications and cooperation.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After conflict with India, China has completed 3-D spatial mapping of its western terrain with centimeter-level accuracy. It will allow China to monitor the region at all times with remote sensing satellites. China has developed and deployed Type 15 light tanks that are suitable for combat in high altitude plateaus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China’s economy will continue to grow. According to IMF, China’s economy will grow by 8.1 percent in 2021, and 5.6 percent in 2022. The difference in growth between western countries and China’s is primarily due to COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>India-China Conﬂict</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>India-China relations have worsened in recent months, with the face-off in Kashmir region signifying the current state of affairs. Recent incidents in Sikkim have complicated eﬀorts at de-escalation. Differences between China and India increased after China constructed a village in southern Tibet near disputed border with India’s Arunachal Pradesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese experts believe that Sino-India relations will not improve in 2021. The ninth Round of India-China Corps Commander Level dialogue on border dispute agreed to push for an early disengagement, but Chinese officials believe that, despite the talks, the face-oﬀs between the two countries would continue in spring after weather improves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While China is attempting to separate border issues with bilateral relations, India is insistent that bilateral relations cannot move ahead without resolving border disputes. Saying India was now at a cross-roads in its relations with China, India’s Foreign Minister S Jaishankar outlined eight principles for improving ties with China. Jaishankar’s speech raised hopes in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India and China’s relations will depend to a great extent on US policies. Will the Biden administration keep on supporting India and prioritize the Indo-Paciﬁc? If Biden’s China policy becomes more moderate, which the Chinese are hoping, it will dent India’s ability to take a hardline stance against China. But news coverage so far indicate that US will be backing India fully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Bloomberg, India’s eﬀorts at military modernization is facing crisis. As its economy contracted by almost 8%, India was able to only modestly increase military expenditure to INR 3.47 trillion. Most of the increase is likely to be used up managing border conﬂict with China, whose military expenditure is almost four times bigger. India currently depends on imports to advance military weapons and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under domestic pressure, conflict with China offers Modi government an excuse that helps deflect criticism. India has permanently banned 59 Chinese apps, which has not gone well with the Chinese.25 Chinese embassy in Delhi asked India to stop doing more harm and engage in cooperation with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although imports from China decreased by almost 20 percent in 2020, India’s eﬀorts to put pressure on China by banning or boycotting Chinese imports has largely failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Other issues</h2>\r\n\r\n<h4>Digital currency and geopolitical rivalry</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>China and India are intensifying efforts to control private digital currencies like Bitcoin and to introduce official digital currencies. China cracked down on Jack Ma and Tencent after perceiving their financial activities (eg, Alipay and WeChat Pay) as a threat to the country’s existing financial system. China’s official digital Yuan will limit the inﬂuence of such companies. China’s efforts to introduce a digital Yuan is seen as a direct threat to the traditional ﬁnancial hegemony led by the US dollar and its geopolitical power. At present discussions are underway to create an international digital currency reserve system. Chinese experts believe that India lags far behind in its economic capability to introduce a digital currency of its own or become a global player.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>UK</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>UK appears to be moving closer to US in terms of foreign policy. UK is planning to convert the G-7 summit meeting into a D-10 (Democratic 10) club, which includes India, South Korea and Australia. China, like some European countries, feels the D-10 is an anti-China move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A British think-tank, Chatham house released a new report, “Global Britain, global broker A blueprint for the UK’s future international role” in January 2021. The report claims Britain has ceded space to the EU as the US’s main counterpart, and that “China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey – may be important to the UK’s commercial interests, but they will be rivals.” The report also recommends that rather than going for a “catchy” Democratic-10 group, UK should engage with mid-sized G20 democracies.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, NULL, '/uploads/banner_image/1671345803_YubrajBista_Bhojpur_RSS_25_bhojpurhiu-1536x512.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-02-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:28:23', '2022-12-18 18:28:50'),

Nepal hasn’t remained untouched by the pandemic, and the government hastily announced a nationwide lockdown to stop the virus from spreading. The government, however, seems to consider the basic principles of pandemic control in its strategy to combat the virus. Despite the low number of positive Coronavirus cases in Nepal as of now, experts are concerned over the inevitable occurrence of the pandemic. Looking at the struggle of even the most developed countries to contain it, a critical question on Nepal’s preparedness, governance, and capacity to handle the looming disaster does arise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven issues such as the prime minister’s kidney transplant and the internal bickering within the ruling party, the cabinet should be able to take decisions even in the absence of the Prime Minister. Perhaps, a heavily medicated prime minister is probably not in the right frame of mind to make decisions that are the need of the hour. The appointment of an officiating executive head for the duration that he is incapacitated could have eased governance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKEY AREAS TO FOCUS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirstly, the frontline medical professionals should be given enough knowledge on the virus, its pathogenicity and transmission modes. With due consideration of the severity, the government should devise a response to contain infectious diseases. Health workers are always on the frontline during medical emergencies, and they should practice safety measures; for this, the necessary steps and required equipment should be in place for them. Amidst various public health concerns, specialized locations across countries should be prepared to strictly deal with COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Epidemic control, mitigation, and suppression should be the key driver for whatever action the government takes. The learnings from other countries should be adapted to the socio-economic context of the country and implemented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a shock-response measure, safety nets should be ensured for the ones who lost their livelihood during and after the lockdown. Even amidst lockdown, the government should guarantee the unbroken supply chain of the daily essentials for life. And with saving lives, the second agenda of saving the economy should come in once measures are in place to prevent the catastrophe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout a doubt, the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic has created upheavals in the world economy. The impact is disastrous and will not spare Nepal as well. Nepal’s economy will be severely affected by the economic turmoil of neighbouring China and India as it is almost dependent on the Chinese and Indian supply chain. Further, the rise in the price of daily consumable goods along with the depreciating value of Nepali rupees against the USD, the inflation rate will go higher up beyond the government’s target of 6% for the year. Given Nepal’s foreign currency reserves dependency on remittance, a reduction will squeeze the liquidity in the domestic financial market, household economic activities, and international trade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the optimism that the economy will rebound, the virus-driven recession will affect more people economically by either causing them to lose their jobs or making them go bankrupt. Tourism and employment will remain the worst-hit areas for further ahead, even after the pandemic comes to an end causing a greater negative impact on Nepal’s economy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen every country is fighting its own battle, Nepal is in it alone for the most part, and people fear this.

Globally as well, the lockdown has created waves of political, economical, social, psychological, and health complications. Coronavirus has killed more than 210 thousand people across the globe and the number of affected has crossed three million. Still, the fire is raging. The rate seems to have slowed down but it is still too early to say if it will die down or this is a pit stop before the race restarts all over again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of May 1, 2020, Nepal has remained comparatively safe from COVID-19, with 59 positive cases, 16 recoveries and no deaths so far. The increase in testing is sure to increase the number of positive patients in the coming days. People are scared and have remained inside their houses, going out only in emergency cases. But how long will people stay is the moot question? With each day of closure, the country is losing millions and we have already closed the country for 40 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal underwent lockdown from March 24, with a complete shutdown of transportation. With the transportation shut down, people who had been traveling to different places within the country were unable to go back to their native places. With the lockdown extending not once, twice or thrice, but four times, some of them decided to return on foot, taking perilous journeys for weeks to be with their families. In the village, even if there is poverty, there is a social safety net in their community, in their family and extended family. In the city, they are no more than a working body. There is a chain that connects them to their families in their villages. They were not here earning for themselves. They are here earning because they need to support poor families in their villages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the lockdown, the government seems to not to have given a thought to policy preparations, to system preparation, to getting in place the Disaster Management Act to making sure that any kind of human crisis did not happen. Lack of foresight and lack of preparedness is clearly seen in the government when it had ample time to prepare itself for it as Nepal remained with only one COVID-19 positive patient for two months. We did not even have mechanisms to have personal protective equipment for our heroic frontline health workers in place until local people came up front and started production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe apathy shown by the government towards its citizens in the time of crisis shows that it does not have a right plan in combating the pandemic, which was clearly seen on how the people had to play with their lives to reach their homes. The situation eased only after the Supreme Court ordered the government to. It does not have any communication with other political parties nor with the local and federal governments to assist in relief and operations. No coordination was seen at all. Instead, the local representatives themselves rose to the occasion to educate, monitor, and help people at the grassroot levels with available resources in hand and a few resources they received from the federal government later.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the government implemented lockdown, there was no clear roadmap as to what they should do after the people were in their homes. The first two weeks were wasted away, with the government unable to procure the necessary medical equipment. Once it did, a huge hole of corruption came out. Even in the time of crisis, there were players who did not hesitate to lynch people off their money. An example is of the Honorary Consul of Kyrgyzstan who was found to be selling thermal guns at record high prices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe prime minister, instead of focusing on how to deal with the pandemic on hand, played a poltical card, which misfired. His untimed ploy to try to break other parties now has him in a shaky position in the current Nepali politics. Not only has the PM lost the trust of his own party leaders but also of the Nepalis globally, who have been watching him since he took the chair as the most powerful person of the country. Now, many believe that the Prime Minister with his new plan to make Bam Dev Gautam as the next PM of the country, is just extending his premiership because no one knows when the Coronavirus pandemic is going to slow down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith weak governance and, therefore, a low approval, PM Oli’s search for legitimacy and power turned towards politics. He attempted to divide the Madhes-based parties, particularly the Samajwadi Party Nepal (SPN) and alter the power equation in Province 2 through a new ordinance amending the Political Party Act, which would have allowed any party to split after a 40% support either in the parliamentary party or in its central committee. The SPN did experience the blow first hand; seven of its 17 MPs, led by lawmaker Renu Yadav, seemed to come together to split and form a new political party. In a precautionary move, however, the Rastriya Janata Party (RJP) and the SPN—who had long been in a negotiation for a merger—united to form Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP), which ruined the 40% dream of the Yadav-led faction. On April 23, the new merger beat the Samajwadi-split group and applied in the Election Commission for registration as one political party. This meant that the splinter group could no more make the required 40% of the new JSP to form their own party, and Oli’s Madhes strategy did not just fail but backfire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with the Political Party Act, Oli proposed amendment to the Constitutional Council Act which says that if the first meeting of the council fails to take a decision, the next meeting shall be called within 24 hours and decisions will be taken based on majority votes of the members present in the meeting. This amendment will give Oli the upper hand, as he can almost all the time have decisions in his favour. This step by the Prime Minister is a way to control the judiciaries and make the members of the constitutional council redundant, thus closing any impeachment threats , if any. PM Oli does not trust anyone, which has been clear by all his maneuvers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBringing these two acts on the amendment table, PM Oli clearly showed that he is not serious on saving people’s lives but on attacking the fundamentals of democracy and parliamentary system.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671346045_COVID-19-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-04', '2020-10-08', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:32:25', '2022-12-18 18:32:25'),

At the national level, this has caused the Nepal Communist party (NCP) to split, and at the international level, this is viewed as major geopolitical loss for China, while India stated that it is an internal matter of Nepal. Political upheavals in Nepal have always been a matter of great concern for China. This is fairly evident through the incessant endeavours of China’s ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi’s attempts to make peace between the two factions in NCP and keep the party intact. Chinese ambassador, on December 20, met president Bidya Devi Bhandari, followed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and few other leaders of their party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After several failed attempts of uniting the two factions, a four-member team of Chinese delegation led by Guo Yenzhou, a vice-minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China arrived in Nepal. The team held meetings independently with several leaders including the President, PM Oli, Nepal, Dahal, Jhalanath Khanal along with Baburam Battarai. The team strived to conciliate the fall-outs between Oli and Dahal, conveying the message that China wants political stability in Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oli’s sudden move left China off-guard. To continue to maintain its influence in Nepal, shortly after, the Chinese team met with Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party leader of Nepali Congress. As per reports, the Chinese President, Xi Jin Ping also invited Deuba to China. Meeting with Deuba seems to be a desperate attempt to bolster its relationship with Nepali Congress. Apart from gauging the intensity of the political crisis, the team also spoke about the progress on the infrastructural development, reinforcement of Nepal-China relationship and mutual cooperation, among other matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Nepal being a part of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China took a massive undertaking to develop infrastructure in Nepal in 2017. In 2020, Nepal also entered into an agreement with the US to receive substantial amount in grants which the parliament is yet to endorse. The presence of MCC proposal itself has been viewed as a potent threat to China’s influence over Nepal. The current political crisis has further placed the pro-MCC faction at an advantage over the anti-MCC opposition. China is apprehensive about this power shift caused by the political turmoil that currently stands in favour of the MCC. However, India has viewed the increased Chinese interaction with Nepal post the house dissolution to be interfering in the internal matters of Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US also has taken the stand that dissolution of the house is Nepal’s internal affair and it should uphold democratic processes while resolving it. Further, as the US instates its new president Joe Biden, it has brought about some changes in its foreign policy to Nepal. On January 20, the US ambassador to Nepal, Randy Berry visited Madhav Kumar Nepal. Subsequently, on January 21, he visited PM Oli. Likewise on January 25, he met the President Bhandari, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, and Sher Bahadur Deuba separately. In the meetings, he discussed primary issues the Biden administration will be harping on. Berry expressed that the new administration will be majorly focusing on four areas such as Indo-Pacific Strategy, endorsement of MCC, the persistent Tibet issue, and ensuring justice to victims of conflict era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although, recently China has deepened its rivalry with India, it is the influence of US over Nepal that holds China’s attention currently. On December 27, 2020, the Trump administration had passed the Tibet Policy and Support Act (TPSA) which requires Nepal to pay regards to the agreement with UNHCR and provide Tibetan refugees legal documentation along with permitting them to completely partake in the economy and society of Nepal. This provision of the Act has put Nepal in a critical geo-political position. The US is putting immense pressure on Nepal to immediately act in consonance with TPSA and India is likely to stand with the US in this regard. Any affirmative action in accordance with the Act most certainly would not sit well with China. Nepal has become a battlefield for two tussling nations to demonstrate its power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Chinese influence increases in Nepal, the image of China being a non-interfering neighbour, slumps. Whereas, India has strategically remained silent in this regard to highlight the desperate attempts of China trying to micromanage Nepal’s internal politics. On the other hand, the neighbourhood first policy that India has adopted has run full-fledged with its vaccine diplomacy. Amidst the political crisis in Nepal, the foreign minister of Nepal flew down to New Delhi to participate in the Sixth Meeting of the Nepal-India Joint Commission on January 15. The meeting was held with an intention to refurbish the loosened ties between India and Nepal. Deliberation was done upon several issues such as trade, connectivity and infrastructural projects amongst others. India agreed upon providing Covid-19 vaccines, and such generosity of India was widely appreciated by Nepal. However India’s reluctance on discussing the on-going border dispute speaks volumes. Even though the relationship between the two countries is not in its best shape yet, it has somewhat uplifted since it hit the all-time low with the emergence of the boundary dispute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is trying to mend relationships with its neighbours which lately has not been free flowing. Nevertheless, it has also been a new contest between China and India to assert power. India has successfully managed to ease China’s growing economic dominance, at least in South-Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, PM Oli, addressing the nation on January 10, stated that both China and India are well-wishers of Nepal and it intends to further foster this relationship. He further said that he aims to resolve the border row and bring back Nepal’s territory, sending a message across to India. However, in the situation of turmoil, Nepal will not be able to endure pressure from three global powers which may lead Nepal to a geo-political dilemma.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671346048_M_XxjpbeE007028_20210212_PEPFN1A001-1536x990.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-02-18', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:32:28', '2022-12-18 18:32:28'),

Nepal’s infection rate has doubled in mere six days. A sense of dread has seeped into everyone’s mind. With the ‘just barely there’ health infrastructure in the country, one question haunts – what will happen if a full-blown COVID-19 infection takes place in Nepal? At a time when countries with the best healthcare systems in the world, such as the USA, the UK, and Italy, buckled under the number of infections brought on by the SARS-COV-II, the healthcare system and the health care workers of Nepal will undoubtedly be under tremendous pressure. Are we too bracing for a never-ending queue of patients in hospitals and are we prepared to send our loved ones off alone with final goodbyes, without being with them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy the beginning of June, Nepalis will have been under lockdown for 70 days. The lockdown, which started on March 24, was supposed to be a time for the government to prepare strategies and plans to tackle this pandemic, but nothing seems to have been done. The recent news that the government has not procured even one ventilator, a piece of essential equipment necessary for serious COVID-19 patients, does not bode well. It seems the government is taking everything for granted – from suggesting to announce Nepal as a Coronavirus-free country to the President claiming, during her Policy and Program announcement that the pandemic has been brought under control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal-India Border Dispute<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn another completely different matter, Nepal and India have been embroiled in a border dispute since November, when India released its ‘updated’ map after revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir; the map placed Kalapani within Indian borders. However, what sparked the latest controversy is India’s inauguration of an 80-kilometer link road passing through the same disputed region, and Nepal’s strong opposition to India’s unilateral action. The newly built road is supposed to serve as the shortest route between India’s capital of New Delhi and Kailash-Mansarovar, a Hindu pilgrimage site in the Tibetan Plateau.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBorders are, of course, a source of conflict, and Nepal and India share roughly 1800-km long open border causing small conflicts every now and then. But what makes our relationship so unique is not only the proximity, it’s our enduring commitment of brotherhood, neighborhood, faith, and the lives we have made as two sovereign countries. And today, more than ever, when the whole world is under the strain of a deadly virus, when the two countries have to come together to fight this pandemic, they are squabbling on the border issue, which is, again, important, but not now. Right now, what both the countries need are national plans to combat this Virus that has claimed more than 373,000 deaths – nearing 5,500 in India alone. Is Nepal trying to shove this pandemic problem out of the reaches of people by bringing in a new narrative of border conflict? By putting a façade of border problems out in the open, is the Oli government trying to hide the bigger problem that it has been unable to address?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRepatriation of Stranded Migrant Workers<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe one concern that should have been on the top of this government’s agenda right now is bringing thousands of migrant workers stranded overseas back to Nepal. Migrant workers in India hit close to home. People have been walking for weeks to get home in Nepal and, en route, are dying due to starvation and exhaustion. People are dying due to the lack of medical attention. The state has failed them. Instead of bringing these stranded migrant workers from India and from different countries, the country has let them be on their own means. After two months of lockdown, the state is gearing up to repatriate its citizens. When will it start, is again the moot question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRelief Programs for Daily Wage Earners<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA porter lost his life in Kathmandu. His lifeless body lay cold and unclaimed. He died of starvation. He died of apathy. With no work for two months, he relied on good Samaritans for food. As the lockdown extended yet again, his frail old body gave away. The government has yet to come out with relief packages for thousands of others like this old man who rely on everyday earnings for their daily sustenance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMental Health during Lockdown<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a data compiled by Nepal Police, the suicide cases across the country increased by 16% in the first month of lockdown only. A total of 875 people committed suicide during the lockdown period of two months. If the lockdown keeps on increasing, the number of suicide cases is sure to increase as psychiatrists have linked the deaths with mental health of people who have been forced to stay indoor during lockdown. It is important that proper measures are brought in place to ease the lockdown and people are given ample information about physical and social distancing in the time of this pandemic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPre-monsoon Preparedness<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPre-monsoon has started, and monsoon is on its way to Nepal. With the pandemic creating havoc in the country, can Nepal brace for the aftermath of monsoon floods that happens annually? Every year, the Terai lowlands see mayhem from floods. People die, their homes are washed away, and their food source is lost. This has been a cycle that keeps on repeating. At this difficult juncture, it has to be made sure that no extra lives are lost this year due to flooding. No one should have to live under tarpaulins with rains lashing them day and night. No one deserves this kind of apathy. The local as well as provincial government should learn from the previous experiences and come up with strategies and plans to avoid similar kinds of tragedy being repeated this year.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671346262_social-distance-5017434_1280-100x60.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-05', '2020-10-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:36:02', '2022-12-18 18:36:02'),

The country finds it hard to strike a balance between its allies and even more so when it becomes the battleground. While India and China both continuously try to ‘expend their influence’ by negating each other’s influence in the South Asian region, the two countries have managed to shake up Nepal’s diplomacy, making it insecure and unstable. It is no secret that the giants are interested in Nepal due to its strategic location. Moreover, the US-India relations have tightened over the pandemic, whereas Indo-Sino relations have worsened, despite growing mutual understanding over the years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia has the opportunity to take advantage of the US-China conflict and lure in foreign investments to relocate from China. However, shifting the industries from China to India while tensions are escalating seems too far-fetched. Additionally, China and India have been facing border issues after China tried to obstruct India’s Border Roads Organization activities in the Galwan region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the need of the hour, it is best for both the giants to look out for the world. They must keep their competition, to become the world superpower, aside.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe month started with the Office of the President ordering new carpets worth Rs 100 million which raised huge protests from different arenas. Many were critical of the untimed purchase at a time when the funds should have been used for COVID-19 care, better quarantine facilities, repatriate Nepali workers who continue to languish abroad for the lack of means to get back home, or to feed the thousands of citizens who are starving because of the prolonged lockdown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople are dying in quarantine areas because of lack of medicine even for a simple disease as diarrhea. Quarantine areas are becoming breeding grounds for Coronavirus and this month saw an exponential rise in the positive cases countrywide. From 1811 cases on June 1, the country has seen more than 13,500 cases with 29 deaths by the end of the month. Nonetheless, more than 3000 people have recovered as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe World Bank decreased Nepal’s economic growth to 1.8-2% as opposed to the finance minister’s target of 7%. This clearly shows how the extended lockdown is affecting the economic growth of the country, though this is the trend globally. Most of the countries are seeing an economic slowdown amidst COVID-19 pandemic and Nepal is not untouched by this. Many people have lost their only source of income and are in the brink of destitution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSiddharth Auji, an employee of Bayalpata Hospital self-immolated as he lost his job. He is an example of how many other people have lost their lives, not to the disease itself, but because of the government’s blind eye to the sufferings of the poor and vulnerable. The government has been unable to bring any relief support to people who rely solely on their only vocation and who have lost it because of the government-imposed lockdown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere was news of how crime has decreased nationally because of the lockdown but it did not highlight how this lockdown has caused increase in suicide rates, domestic violence, sexual abuse and many social evils. Maternal mortality has increased 200% whereas many children have not received their mandatory immunizations, causing fear of spread of preventable diseases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlbeit late, the Nepali government started to repatriate its citizens stranded in different countries. Chartered flights are bringing in the migrant workers from different destinations but there are still questions about their quarantine and self-isolations. There are a certain section of people who cannot afford to self-isolate at their homes and they need to be provided a station where they can be safely evaluated for COVID-19. But the government is still in confusion and are sending these people back home asking some simple questions. Bringing our people back is a commendable and laudable effort by the government but charging the workers for their flights has been a drawback. How can a country whose 1/3rd GDP relies on the remittances sent by these people charge them for coming back to their own country amidst a pandemic? The Supreme Court then issued an interim order to the government to bring the stranded workers by its own expenses. Now, the government will bear the full costs of the return ticket of those workers who are returning within a year of their migration, and have valid labor permits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with the repatriation, bodies of dead migrant workers were also repatriated. During the lockdown, 318 deceased bodies of migrant workers had stuck in the various destination countries.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671346447_rupani-nursery-planting-saplings-daily-work1-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-06', '2020-10-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:39:07', '2022-12-18 18:39:07');

The Attorney General’s office on July 23 filed a review petition in the Apex Court to rehear the case. The Attorney General along with senior advocates has denounced the decision of the court,[2] and rightly so; the judgment comprises of multiple flaws and has gone against fundamental legal principles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRanjan Koirala, a former deputy inspector general of the Nepal Armed Police Force, was pronounced guilty of killing his wife Gita Dhakal on January 12, 2012, and burning the body so as to leave no trace of evidence. He was given a sentence to life imprisonment along with seizure of his property by the Kathmandu District Court, which was subsequently upheld by the Patan Appellate Court. Lately, after Koirala had spent 8 years in prison, the Supreme Court, in the bench led by the Chief Justice, Cholendra Shumsher Rana, and Justice Tej Bahadur KC overturned the decision of the lower courts and waived off the remaining jail-term and freed the convict presenting baseless arguments. Furthermore, the court’s reasoning that the convict’s son, who is of a legal age, needs to be taken care of by his father is debatable. Another staggering reason provided by the judges was that they ‘felt’ that lifetime imprisonment for the crime Koirala has committed was disproportionate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, the reference of precedents is unmentioned in substantiating the reason behind releasing the convict. The court has completely disregarded previous judgments that form a legal basis for deciding the case. The court has also not deliberated upon the theory behind Section 188 of Muluki Ain, which confers a discretionary power to deduct the sentence of the prisoners on reasonable and rational grounds. The Judges have to weigh between the severity of the crime, the circumstances under which it was committed, and the personality of the criminal while exercising discretionary power. However, in this case, the judges have abused the use of discretionary power, which should be reserved for the most compelling of cases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe term ‘justice’ is often understood as being fairn, impartial, without prejudices, honest, objective, and is unsentimental. Along with this, the concept of justice being served is coupled with receiving what one deserves. It is a widely accepted fact that one should be held liable for their actions. However, due to judgments like this, people are losing confidence in the justice delivering mechanism, and the integrity of the court is diminishing. Further, it reinforces systemic violence and does injustice to the victim’s family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe verdict is a classic illustration of a bad judgment delivered by the court. This would set a bad precedent and affect the subsequent cases. A bad judgment leaves a greater impact in the society, as it encourages impunity, which leads to increment in violence. Nevertheless, the petition for revision has brought a new hope for justice. It appears that the court has taken this matter seriously after facing much condemnation from the general public as well as senior practitioners of law. Whether the judgment will be overturned is a different question altogether, but the acceptance of the appeal made to court for the review of the particular case itself indicates the decision is fallacious. There are manifold instances of judgments being appealed for revision that are overturned. The judges, including the Chief Justice are not supposed to know every letter of the law; however, the approach the bench has taken in this particular case is dubious and raises ethical questions about the Chief Justice.[3]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing this case, the Supreme Court released a press statement on July 27, which was unwarranted. The Court should not curtail the voice of the public and should be open to criticisms.[4]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, another instance that can be taken in similar light, is the case of Nirmala Panta. The thirteen year old was raped and then murdered on July 26 2018.[5] Two years have passed since the case was instituted in the Court and the case has seen no progress. The foremost reason behind the delay in the delivering of the justice is seen to be the negligence in the investigating process by the police. Police has a major role to play in conducting a proper investigation and gathering all the relevant evidence for the court to reach a verdict. The justice system of the country is evidence-based, thus evidence holds utmost importance in determining the case. However, in this case the eight police officers were found destroying forensic evidence; shielding the culprit.[6] The case was filed in Kanchanpur District Court against eight police officials accusing them of felony of evidence tampering. Police are deemed one of the pillars of the justice system; gross negligence on the part of the police has a huge bearing on justice being denied to the victim. Moreover, it perpetuates systemic violence to the victim and her family, further victimizing them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, the unfounded statement from police blaming the global pandemic for the deferment of the investigation merely questions the credibility and competency of the Nepal Police.[7] The act of distorting evidence itself comes under the scope of miscarriage of justice, however, the Kanchanpur District Court absolving eight police officials on July 30 further questions the veracity of the Justice delivering mechanism.[8] The court has simply ignored the gravity of the crime the police officials had committed. Such decisions of the court encourages criminals, as they can easily escape repercussions of their crimes. Such negligent and heedless behavior of the court has visibly shaken the trust of the public on justice mechanisms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConstitutionally, the Executive and the Judiciary are entrusted with the responsibility to enforce law and order and protect the rule of law by interpreting it, respectively. In fact, after the Legislative, these two constitutional bodies should function in a way to check and balance each other and ensure that people feel protected by the state mechanism. The cases of Ranjan Koirala, Nirmala Panta, and several others in the recent years, however, demonstrate otherwise. In multiple instances, both the executive and the judiciary have worked to undermine the legal supremacy and have instead operated to serve personal interests of those holding a position of power. Such irresponsibilities have antagonized the public and have let to what we may confortably call a miscarriage of the justice system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuthor: Lumana Uprety; Uprety is currently working as an intern at CESIF Nepal.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671346628_thumb-100x54.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:42:08', '2022-12-18 18:42:08'),

Most countries are struggling to combat this issue and Nepal is no exception. The number of child sexual abuse cases reported in past few months is alarming, and the number has been rocketing by the day. According to the reports of the National Child Rights Council, 72 children were victims to sexual abuse, rape in precise, since July to November, 2077.[1] This has caused tremendous distress for the nation’s efforts in development. Children need extra protection as they are more vulnerable to physical, sexual, mental, and psychological threats. Children are the future generation and it is imperative that they get an environment to develop to their full potential. Healthy children in terms of physical, emotional, and psychological health are vital for the future prosperity of any society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rape has been recognised as one of the major crimes that occur frequently in the country. The concerning factor is that children are being targeted as the victim of this crime. As per the statistics of Nepal Police, 2,144 cases of rape and 687 attempt to rape cases were reported in the fiscal year 2019/20, out of which majority of the victims were minors.[2] In Nepal, 13% to 18% of children fall victim to sexual abuse.[3] Police also stated that in almost all the cases, the perpetrator is known to the victim.[4] Statistically, 80% of the rapes are committed by victims’ close relatives, neighbours, and even their fathers. [5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In milieu of this, it becomes pertinent to understand the factors relating to soaring cases of minor rapes in the country. One of the main reasons behind child sexual abuse is that children are easy prey for the perpetrators as they can be easily manipulated and mishandled. They are unable to understand what is being done to them. Due to this, children usually fail to communicate their suffering. The rapists get a sense of security that their act will never be revealed, which encourages them to continue committing such crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, many rape cases go unreported and unaddressed owing to the stigma attached to it. The rape incidents are suppressed as it is believed to bring shame in the family. Relatives and family members, in most of the cases, do not support the victim and try to cover up for the rapists. Further, in majority of the rape cases, the victim and her family are forced to have an out of court settlement with the perpetrator. Dismissal of rape cases on the basis of settlement is further encouraging the rapists. Criminals are absolved without facing any repercussions. This promotes rape culture and instils a belief in perpetrators that they can get away even after committing heinous crimes. For instance, the incident of rape of a 14-year-old girl in Bajhang, where she was made to settle the matter on a condition that the rapist would bear the responsibility of her and the child, if she got pregnant. Further, her rapist was made to apologise by placing Rs 500 at her feet. In less than a week, the same person raped and murdered another 12-year-old girl.[6] This instance makes it apparent that perpetrators have no fear of facing legal sanctions which encourages them to flagrantly commit such crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the observation with regard to the causes of CSA is based on practical findings. There are no concrete studies depicting as to why there is a surge in the rate of CSA in the past few years. There is lack of substantive knowledge on psychology of child sexual abusers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rape incidents in the month of November</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data of child rape in the month of November gathered from various news portals is tabulated below.</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>S.N</th>\r\n			<th>Date</th>\r\n			<th>Age of the victim</th>\r\n			<th>Age of the Perpetrator</th>\r\n			<th>Location</th>\r\n			<th>Relation</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>1.</td>\r\n			<td>Nov 2</td>\r\n			<td>11 years</td>\r\n			<td>60 years</td>\r\n			<td>Makwanpur</td>\r\n			<td>Not mentioned[7]</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>2.</td>\r\n			<td>Nov 2</td>\r\n			<td>10 years</td>\r\n			<td>51</td>\r\n			<td>Janakpur</td>\r\n			<td>Not mentioned[8]</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>3.</td>\r\n			<td>Nov 11</td>\r\n			<td>7 years</td>\r\n			<td>52 years</td>\r\n			<td>Gothatar</td>\r\n			<td>Person known to the victim[9]</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>4.</td>\r\n			<td>Nov 14</td>\r\n			<td>17 years</td>\r\n			<td>4 men (one of which is 25 years)</td>\r\n			<td>Kapilvastu</td>\r\n			<td>Boyfriend and his friends[10]</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>5.</td>\r\n			<td>Nov 17</td>\r\n			<td>14 years</td>\r\n			<td>23 years</td>\r\n			<td>Basundol</td>\r\n			<td>Neighbour[11]</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>6.</td>\r\n			<td>Nov. 19</td>\r\n			<td>3 years</td>\r\n			<td>Two men, age not revealed</td>\r\n			<td>Makwanpur</td>\r\n			<td>Not mentioned[12]</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>7.</td>\r\n			<td>Nov 25</td>\r\n			<td>6 years</td>\r\n			<td>25 years</td>\r\n			<td>Bardibas</td>\r\n			<td>Neighbour[13]</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>8.</td>\r\n			<td>Nov 27</td>\r\n			<td>13 years</td>\r\n			<td>39 years</td>\r\n			<td>Pokhara</td>\r\n			<td>Father[14]</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>In the month of November itself, eight rape cases of minors were reported, however, this is not an exhaustive list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Endeavours to tackle the issue</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the incident of rape and murder of a six-year-old girl child in Bardibas, there was a huge public outcry condemning the crime.[15] The agitated locals came to the street to protest on November 24 and it has continued for several days despite a subsequently imposed curfew.[16] Furthermore, the government has endorsed an ordinance on rape to address the soaring rate of sexual violence. The ordinance is viewed as an affirmative measures in ensuring justice to the sexual violence victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent ordinance has sought to bring amendments to the current laws on rape to make it more stringent by increasing the span of imprisonment.[17] One of the positive aspects of the ordinance is that it is gender neutral. Laws relating to rape in Nepal have finally recognised that people of other genders, not only female, can also be raped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the ordinance has also provisioned for recourse against people that compel rape victims to enter a settlement with the perpetrator. The provision in the ordinance states that people involved in forcing the victim for reconciliation will face three years’ imprisonment and fine up to Rs 30,000. In case of involvement of police, public servants and court thereof, further imprisonment punishment of six months will be added.[18] This step holds a great amount of significance in curbing the issue of rape as out of court settlement is seen to be the biggest hurdle in ensuring justice to the victim as well as the one of the major causes of surging number of rape cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the rate in which inter and intra familial child sexual abuse is increasing every year, children are not safe within their own houses. The impact of it on children is devastating, which may lead to depression, social anxiety, severe physical harm, and mental trauma. It affects the growth of the children. Rape and sexual abuse are the worst form of maltreatment to children. There is an urgent need to address this issue and efforts have been made. However, merely bringing new laws would not suffice to reduce child sexual abuse. Mass awareness with regard to rape and its consequence is required. Further, thorough implementation of the laws is of utmost importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style: none;\">\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[1]https://ncrc.gov.np/storage/resources/downloads/2020/Feb/05/1580883044sawan_kartil_ist_quater_2076.pdf</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[2] https://risingnepaldaily.com/main-news/minors-are-majority-victims-of-rapes-in-past-year</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[3]https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/sijssr/article/download/28910/23531/#:~:text=In%20Nepal%2C%2013%25%20to%2018,are%20victims%20of%20sexual%20abuse. </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[4] https://english.khabarhub.com/2020/08/74083/ </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[5] Ibid. </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[6] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/rape-cases-on-the-rise-in-sudur-pashchim-province-as-most-cases-are-dismissed-through-settlement/?fbclid=IwAR14andEYv4Hk1G8p-eMwxnlyOymIlC3CRhV_8iGC5wq5nw7aFBbTz78vWo </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[7] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/sexagenarian-arrested-on-charge-of-raping-minor/?fbclid=IwAR33adO64vgWSrOeY8P3l1i3O3mtPUbddXTpeFeVhYiybuQnN3qJMV6AarM </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[8] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/indian-national-arrested-on-charges-of-kidnapping-and-raping-10-year-old-girl-in-janakpur/?fbclid=IwAR1RNHByluQqCAO2ywB7Akkrev2JR1_cDyYL06-yotdZn7ZJQzL6B1dcxBw </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[9] https://english.onlinekhabar.com/man-arrested-for-raping-seven-year-old-girl-in-kathmandu.html?fbclid=IwAR3HkUy9ramUS-lmBRqXjSONHgp46Nk6Im1H0IsdiFGQLQm2s_Nix3C9hRo </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[10] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/teenage-girl-hanged-to-death-after-gang-rape-in-kapilvastu/?fbclid=IwAR2xzFn3ZHy_z5PKSG2gIkfJTBrD6cNhCBlqBYH8DnJuzmAX2U2Prr2iW2w </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[11] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/man-held-on-charge-of-raping-14-year-old-giril-in-capital/?fbclid=IwAR22FsVQbvvImHjHp-jTxnBtN_7kiAVvo9x7A2qF3GKBn9loq4XDjnzZOyE </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[12] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/101129/?fbclid=IwAR14andEYv4Hk1G8p-eMwxnlyOymIlC3CRhV_8iGC5wq5nw7aFBbTz78vWo </a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[13] https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2020/11/25/six-year-old-missing-girl-found-dead-rape-and-subsequent-murder-suspected?fbclid=IwAR0-hgKKs2tAGCfUWg2MjDffvlmvgE61Xw3W-YT49chg5X-jIlxgpD3wp6s</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671360549_default-img.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12-04', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:43:49', '2022-12-18 22:34:09'),

The Himalayan nation is globally ranked extremely high in terms of susceptibility to geophysical and climate hazards.', NULL, '<p>Each year natural disasters claim lives of several innocents in Nepal. The Himalayan nation is globally ranked extremely high in terms of susceptibility to geophysical and climate hazards.[1] More than 80% of the population is vulnerable to some type of risk that arises from natural disasters which makes Nepal one of the most disaster-prone countries.[2] While Nepal is prone to most of these disasters, floods and landslides seem to have become a regular phenomenon. Nepalis have lost lives, poultry, livestock, vegetation and property worth billions over the years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn erratic rainfall pattern has developed over the past few years as a result of increasing population, deforestation, unplanned settlements, poorly built roads, and urbanization of flood plains. The rain-induced disasters during the months of June-September have caused extensive destruction to human life. Consequently, there have been infectious water-borne diseases in the aftermath, which only worsen the recovery. Since 2011, according to DRR, 1,550 recorded human lives have been lost to these disasters. The estimated financial loss for the same stands at Rs 18 billion approximately.[3]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecently, amid the infamous coronavirus pandemic, casualties due to landslides and floods have made it to the headlines again, like every other year. The disasters have forced several families to displace or relocate. The situation is miserable in the Terai region as few municipalities have completely been swamped by floodwaters where police and locals are also unable to extend support.[4] Likewise, the landslides and avalanches along the Himalayan belt have made the lives of locals there unpredictable. Human-made faulty constructions primarily trigger these recent lethal landslides and floods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, despite countless lives being lost to floods and landslides each year, government plan and response has been inappropriately minimal. The graph below suggests how there are fatalities each year, and yet the government has failed to take a concrete measure towards environment protection and climate change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal Disaster Risk Reduction has reached milestones but has lacked in implementation. Most of the plans and policies are merely on paper and do not provide any provision for immediate mitigation, nor does it target risk reduction.[5]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, there is no shortage of disaster management institutions across the country. There are recognized Relief Committees in all the regions. The government of Nepal has established the National Council, Executive Committee, National disaster Risk Reduction Management Authority, and Disaster Management Committees at the province, district, and local levels as per the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act 2017.[6] Yet Nepalis continue to lose their lives and loved ones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike each succeeding year, the conversations and meeting dry up as the rainwater does. Millions and billions of rupees have been allocated for disaster management, but no local or provincial government seems to have utilized it efficiently. While the relief packages provide a short-term solution, no long-term mechanism is in place for risk reduction and mitigation. The attitude of the government towards the natural disaster is worrisome and shouldn’t be taken lightly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe more concerning issue is the government’s ability to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. If the government has failed to establish distinct protocols and relief for a disaster that is expected each year, how will it control the spread of an unexpected fatal virus? The government’s decision to impose a nation-wide lockdown was initially lauded since it provided time for preparedness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, lack of government initiatives, preparedness and provisions during the lockdown left the citizens furious. While most countries took steps towards making the economy safer by imposing rules to contain community spread, Nepal’s lockdown kept getting longer without any plan. Months went by, and no strategy was in place to gradually open up Nepal’s economy so that labours could be employed again. The government failed to establish protocols leading to unfathomable loss. Experts have also attested that the initial months of lockdown did more harm than good to the nation. Nepal’s government recently started lifting the lockdown across the towns but still doesn’t have enough PCR testing kits or adequate medical facilities for a patient. There are minimal ventilators, and the death toll is on the rise. The government’s obliviousness in the face of the pandemic was heavily criticized. It only indicated the government’s unaccountable and unreliable attitude.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government response to the disaster and the virus is evidently inadequate. The grassroots problem seems to be the general outlook— emphasis on relief and rescue operations, which is also inefficient. Instead of focusing on the aftermath of disasters, the government must address the contributing factor and concentrate on mitigating the risk. The primary approach should be to establish a precautionary and prevention strategy.[7] The government must identify learnings from past events in order to recognize the errors which can be avoided in the future. Similarly, the government must be dedicated to the coronavirus cause and implement a well-thought-out plan of action which is robust. The government’s ability to manage a crisis is fundamental to its next election and power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuthor: Shraddha More: More is a junior research fellow at CESIF-Nepal.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha More', '/uploads/banner_image/1671346812_waterways-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:45:12', '2022-12-18 18:45:12'),

[1]The Minister of Information and Communications announced that “the government has determined that since the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is going down, and public is aware of precautions that need to be taken, we can start opening the lockdown but if the infection rate goes up again, the lockdown could be re-imposed.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lifting of lockdown in Nepal has also lifted spirits in a manner that would have seemed inconceivable four months ago. With most restrictions on the movement of people and vehicles removed, life at least in the capital appears to have gone back to normal with offices resumed, people frequenting restaurants, and meeting with friends and family. Although the direction of lifting the lockdown should be welcomed, as prolonging such strict measures adversely impact the economy, livelihood, and mental health. However, the false sense of security that has come from lifting the lockdown can be risky because cases have continued to rise and there is no robust mechanism in place to deal with a possible outbreak. [2]The WHO representative to Nepal has warned that “the end of lockdown does not mean going back to the life before lockdown”. In these circumstances, the announcement to end the lockdown appears premature and rushed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed gaps between hogwash and reality. [3]The chaotic coordination between various levels of government, the failure to procure essential equipment for testing, the continued use of RDT kits for diagnosis instead of surveillance purposes, corruption, denial, and other failures in managing the pandemic has shattered illusions of competence. [4]The WHO has warned that coronavirus lockdowns must only be lifted when a government’s contact tracing system has proven to be robust and effective. However, it appears that the government lacks an exit strategy from the restrictions in the same manner it haphazardly imposed the lockdown when the pandemic first began to unravel. An exit strategy must be based on the risk assessment of a country’s context and Nepal appears to still be in an active phase of the pandemic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government has denied trends of community transmission, disregarding warnings from public health officials on the need to ramp up testing and contact tracing. [5]The Ministry of Health maintains that we are still in the cluster stage, as per the WHO definition. However, whether we are in the cluster or community spread stage is a moot point because this is an unfolding pandemic, and total caseloads are still rising exponentially in neighboring India and around the world. Furthermore, once safety measures are relaxed, contact tracing becomes the key with greater reason.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government garbled communication with citizens, even failing to articulate the primary purpose of a blanket lockdown. Daily press briefings provided updates on new cases, number of tests conducted, covid-19 related deaths, and number of recovered patients but failed to communicate what the lockdown was achieving for Nepal. [6]Once lockdowns were lifted, cases spiked up here and there. That was always going to be true. However, incapability to respond to such developments may defeat any purpose the lockdown may have served.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government must make active efforts in launching a nationwide awareness campaign with the message that the lockdown may be over but the pandemic is not. Furthermore, the campaign should highlight safety protocols and precautions. Since it is expected that cases will rise after restrictions are relaxed, the government should ramp up efforts in mass community testing and contact tracing. It is not safe to lift a lockdown until we know more about the virus, however, gradually removing restrictions in phases, strict enforcement of safety protocols, and taking personal precautions will allow the country to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuthor: Shuvangi Poudyal; Poudyal is a research fellow at CESIF-Nepal</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671347004_coronavirus-4924022_1280-100x51.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:48:24', '2022-12-18 18:48:24'),

In the first week of November, Pfizer Inc. announced that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine proved to be over 90% effective. [1]Following the news, high ranking officials created a committee and scheduled a meeting on December 10 to discuss the procurement process of the vaccines. [2]The committee’s purpose is to conduct research regarding the vaccines being developed by foreign pharmaceutical companies, while also following the required procedures and process to procure the vaccines. According to reports, the government is considering various countries that are involved in the process of finding a vaccine because while they prioritize the vaccine developed by Pfizer, whether or not the government will turn elsewhere depends on the cost and availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the World Health Organization, 11 vaccines being developed in different parts of the world including USA, China, Russia, and India are in the third phase of clinical trials. In efforts to speed up the process of procuring enough and effective vaccines, [3]the government of Nepal has sent diplomatic notes to countries including China, India, the US, the UK, Russia, and Australia for early availability in Nepal. [4]During his visit to Nepal in late November, the Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla assured that once in India rolls out COVID-19 vaccines, meeting Nepal’s requirements would be a priority for India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past few months, the government of Nepal has been in talks with various international companies regarding conducting phase III clinical trials of a possible COVID-19 vaccine in Nepal, but the process was halted as experts were divided on the safety of the vaccine. [5]However, recent reports say that the government has initiated talks to bring “Coronavac”, a vaccine created by China based “Sinovac Biotech”, to conduct clinical trials in Nepal. However, the government is yet to make a decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Communications Minister said that the cabinet meetings in early November had made certain decisions including the government approving a proposal and action-plan for the use of COVID-19 vaccine in Nepal. [6] Other decisions include the restriction on people arriving from border points into Nepal until December 15, 2020, in efforts to curb the spread of the virus. Furthermore, minister and state ministers will deposit 50% of their wages from mid-October to mid-April in the COVID-19 Prevention, Control, and Treatment Fund set up by the government. [7]The government has also introduced an ordinance authorizing the Department of Drug Administration to register the vaccines of infectious diseases that have been declared as an epidemic or pandemic and to make necessary recommendations to provide import licenses to the firms or institutions to import vaccines as per the ordinance. He also added that COVID-19 patients that meet a certain criteria would be treated for free of cost per the third Amendment Order-2077 BS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the news of possible vaccines for COVID-19 is promising and welcomed by all, the whole world is in line to procure and distribute the vaccine to their people, once a vaccine is approved for mass production. Under such circumstances, the government of Nepal must leave no stone unturned in the process of getting sufficient amounts of vaccines as soon as possible. Furthermore, proper execution of the proposal and action plan for the use of COVID-19 vaccine in Nepal should be ensured through transparency, following protocol, and maintaining coordination between agencies involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0;\">\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[1] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/govt-holding-discussions-to-procure-pfizer-vaccine-claimed-to-be-over-90-effective/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[2] https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nepal-govt-forms-committee-to-procure-covid-19-vaccine/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[3] https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/11/27/nepal-joins-the-race-to-get-the-vaccine-but-when-and-how-is-still-up-in-the-air</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[4] https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nepal-on-priority-for-covid-19-vaccine-indian-foreign-secretary-harsh-vardhan-shringla/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[5] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/govt-mulls-over-bringing-chinese-vaccine-for-clinical-trial-in-nepal/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[6] https://risingnepaldaily.com/mustread/proposal-and-action-plan-to-use-covid-19-vaccine-approved</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[7] https://www.wionews.com/south-asia/nepal-seeks-early-availability-of-covid-19-vaccines-344665</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671347110_vaccination-5502034_1280-100x83.png', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12-04', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:50:10', '2022-12-18 18:50:10'),

Concerned with prime minister and party co-chair KP Sharma Oli’s ‘unilateral’ and dictatorial handling of both the party and the government, NCP leaders finally convened for a standing committee meeting on 24 June 2020. The meeting’s primary agendas included reflection upon Oli’s performance and a discussion of current affairs; however, the NCP supremo’s controversial accusation of his party leaders conspiring with India to unseat him and his move to get the president to prorogue the parliament[1] infuriated the leaders. Suddenly then, Oli’s resignation became the primary agenda of the standing committee meeting, primarily among the members who belonged to the faction led by NCP co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and senior leader Madhav Nepal.[2]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe NCP dispute currently stands at a verge of a split. On one hand, the Dahal-Nepal faction is adamant on their demand for Oli’s resignation from either of the two posts, whereas on the other hand, Oli remains firm to quit neither.[3] The journey back to this standstill saw several postponements of the standing committee meeting and back-channel and informal negotiations for compromise.[4] Even China’s Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, met the NCP leaders and the president, allegedly in to mediate an agreement.[5] [6] All the efforts to preserve the party unity seemed to have failed when PM Oli decided to ‘unilaterally’ call off the standing committee meeting scheduled for 28 July 2019. The Nepal-Dahal faction chose to hold the meeting anyway.[7] Running out of options, Oli met NCP deputy chair Bamdev Gautam later on the same day for a ‘family dinner.’[8] On the same day, Gautam had presented a six-point proposal, in a bid to avoid party split, which some speculated to have brought Gautam closer to Oli.[9] However, the party’s crisis has worsened, for the latest event saw 152 members of the Central Working Committee demand a meeting as soon as possible—a move that puts pressure on Oli to step down.[10]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the erstwhile NCP–Unified Marxist Leninist (UML) and NCP–Maoist Centre (MC) officially merged on 17 May 2018, Nepal Communist Party has experienced several rows, disagreements, and disputes. Most of those concerned the party’s organizational structure, management of the leaders, and Oli’s handling of the party and the government. However, none of them lasted for such an extended period, with Oli’s resignation as the cornerstone of the dispute. Either internal negotiations or self-criticism of the party leaders or intervention of external factors solved the disagreements in the past. However, the ongoing conflict has proved all the past efforts of reconciliation and mediation to be futile. And the futility only speaks of the cracks in the party unification, which has worsened due to PM Oli’s authoritarian tendencies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe erstwhile NCP–UML and NCP–MC merged not due to their natural ideological affinity but rather due to the political necessity of the two parties and their leaders. While the Dahal-led NCP-MC suffered a massive electoral loss in 2013, leadership dealignment, and party split, NCP–UML also needed a solid electoral strategy to perform well in the 2017 elections. Realizing their necessities, therefore, the two parties first made an electoral alliance and later officially merged on 17 May 2018.[11] Many analysts saw their unity as “a marriage of convenience” rather than “a result of conviction” because the merger would benefit only a few top leaders and serve their petty interests.[12] Indeed, the unholy alliance and the unnatural unification soon exposed the party’s ideological crisis. Despite their shared heritage in communism, the two parties differed significantly on their acceptance of the Maoism, Leninism, and Marxism. NCP–UML’s adoption of the People’s Multiparty Democracy and NCP–MC’s firm rejection of it was the most pronounced difference between them. Despite the differences, the parties merged to increase their likelihood of power and an opportunity to share the spills. What lacked were enough exercise and preparation for leadership management in the party, which lies at the root of the occasional infighting within the ruling NCP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Dahal claims the ongoing party dispute to be ‘an important ideological battle,’[13] it appears to be a crisis of leadership management. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, KP Sharma Oli, Madhav Nepal, Bamdev Gautam, Jhalanath Khanal, and other senior leaders in the party have led major blocks of their parties, have held essential ranks in the party, or even been the country’s prime minister in the past. For them to succumb to an individual who overlooks the existing party mechanisms and sidelines them entirely must feel humiliating. In addition to Oli’s ineffective yet dictatorial governance, rampant corruption by his people also concerns those who have not been a part of the club, for they find themselves inaccessible to both power and money. The intra-party dissatisfaction in Oli’s performance had remained for a long time. The fact that his resignation became the crux of the dispute only after he accused his party leaders of conspiring with India shows that this crisis also has to do with an ego clash among the Khas-Arya men in power. A slipping approval rating of PM Oli’s government only presents the needed opportunity for the disgruntled leaders to pour their frustration, for his performance and actions have upset the leaders and the people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDahal’s claim that the dispute is a serious battle of ideologies does have some ground, though. He asserted that it is now a high time to decide whether the party moves towards socialism or still dwells in capitalism.[14] Indeed, the Oli government’s plans and actions have seemed to favor crony capitalists instead of helping the poor and marginalized. To completely overlook the ‘socialism’ factor—the cornerstone of the communist unification— is a matter of concern for all in favor of unity. Oli’s recent attempt to court Dahal for an early convention, with People’s Multiparty Democracy as a condition[15] and the registration of the CPN-UML in the Election Commission[16] further validates Oli’s lenience towards his old banner of multiparty democracy. From this perspective, the dispute is about party unification and its ideological clarity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the country likely heading towards a serious COVID-19 crisis and several socio-economic challenges, the ruling NCP remains at a standstill, trying to solve its internal issues. While Oli has displayed his unwavering reluctance to respect either of the major agreements—colloquially known as Jestha 2 and Mangsir 4 agreements—and cede either the government or the party chair, the Dahal-Nepal faction seems determined to reach a conclusion this time by hook or by crook. So far, internal negotiations and exercise for dispute settlement as well as external mediation have failed to yield any positive development. Unless Oli pulls some miracle, which he usually manages to do, the ruling NCP appears to have more challenges ahead, which is bad news for the entire country and its still consolidating democracy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuthor: Mahesh Kushwaha; Kushwaha is a junior research fellow at CESIF Nepal.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Mahesh Kumar Kushwaha', '/uploads/banner_image/1671347208_oli-dahal-100x56.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:51:48', '2022-12-18 18:51:48');

Four significant events set the core for the new trends in the future of Nepal’s bilateral relations with its neighbours and other superpowers—Joe Biden’s win at the US Presidential elections, Indian Army Chief Naravane’s visit, Indian Foreign Secretary Harshvardhan Shringla’s visit, and the Chinese Defence minister’s meeting. These trends will shape the Himalayan country’s geopolitical position.

This meeting raised eyebrows as it didn’t follow the diplomatic protocol and did not go well with the public. While few viewed this as a move to revive the soured bilateral ties, some criticised New Delhi’s decision to send the intelligence chief. Senior officials revealed that the visit might be a step to arrange for a high-level exchange after the Indian Army Chief’s ceremony in Nepal. However, the ruling NCP’s members were disgruntled with the unofficial visit as Bishnu Rijal, deputy chief of the foreign affairs department of the ruling party, added that ‘politicians should not overstep in matters related to diplomacy’.[1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the ceremonial visit of the Indian Army Chief Naravane was scheduled for the first week of November when internal ruling party issues in Nepal were intensifying. This was the first high-level visit since Nepal-India ties soured due to boundary dispute. However, the then Defence Minister Ishwor Pokharel was verbally critical of the Army Chief over his statement about Nepal ‘acting at the behest of someone else’, hinting at China; therefore, ahead of the visit, PM Oli assigned himself as the Defence Minister. This decision along with appointing other ministers upset the party chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal who later went on to call the decision a ‘unilateral move’.[2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian Army Chief’s visit was welcomed as it was one more step towards reviving the bilateral ties. However, a member of the task force, which was “formed by the government to prepare the position paper on how to deal with boundary issues with India”[3] had objected to the visit. Questions about the visitor’s position were again raised as meeting with the Military chief will not resolve diplomatic issues. However, the Oli administration was optimistic about the visit. Rajan Bhattarai, the foreign relations advisor to the PM, shared that other India-Nepal engagements such as trade, commerce, business, transit and agriculture have been running smoothly. Indian Army Chief Naravane added that he was ‘delighted’ to visit Nepal.[4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon Naravane’s visit, he was bestowed with the highest honorary title by President Bidya Devi Bhandari, and he met with PM Oli on his last day of the visit. This was merely supposed to be a courtesy call, but ‘the elephant in the room couldn’t be ignored’. PM Oli brought up the border issue as he communicated Nepal’s stance on resolving the dispute. Everyone present in the meeting expressed willingness to resume high-level discussions. However, there was criticism around the intelligence and army’s chiefs visit to resolve boundary dispute; something that shouldn’t fall under their jurisdiction. Therefore, few expressed discontentment over the way Oli was conducting foreign policy and diplomacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this visit, news about the probable visit of Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had already started surfacing. These exchanges and initiatives were an indication towards warming Nepal-India relations which had soured for over a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though an official statement about Harsh Vardhan’s visit hadn’t been made, sources close to the MoFa had shared the news with the media. The official announcement was made soon enough as both countries disclosed the primary agenda for the meeting—the ongoing boundary dispute. However, the visit will only be an introductory one around the border issue. This visit will also ‘pave the way’ for Pradeep Gyawali’s meeting in New Delhi for December 2020. Both the countries are planning to hold the sixth meeting of Nepal-India Joint Commission at the foreign minister level.[5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers observed that India is continuously engaging with its neighbouring countries due to geopolitical reasons and fears that its neighbours will tilt towards China; therefore, it has been improving relations in the south Asian region.[6]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian Foreign Secretary Shringla arrived in Kathmandu for a two-day visit on November 26. He met with high-level diplomats in the country including PM Oli. He further met with his Nepali counterpart Bharat Raj Paudyal to discuss various aspects of the bilateral relations. Both secretaries agreed on several initiatives and projects and decided to take it forward on mutual cooperation. However, the meeting failed to address the boundary issue. It was not on the official agenda due to the complications around it. The focus of the meeting was that both sides have agreed to restore friendly relations. Shringla added that Nepal and other neighbours of India are unspoken “priorities” of India to make the vaccine accessible. The consecutive visits of Indian envoys have created a positive atmosphere for further communication and dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid statements about Indian foreign secretaries visit, China also decided to send its envoy to Nepal. This visit was scheduled for two days after Shringla’s. China’s Defence Minister Wei Fenghe arrived in Kathmandu for a day’s visit on November 28. Experts opined that Kathmandu has once again become host to geopolitical games and failing to strike a balance will turn Nepal into a battleground for the foreign players.[7] Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi is also frequently seen meddling with NCP’s internal party issues. This has time and again raised questions regarding Nepal’s sovereignty. Chinese have remained persistent to keep the ruling NCP intact and have crossed its jurisdiction to maintain it. China seems to be threatened by the continuous visits from India and therefore decided to send its envoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, India seems stern at reviving Nepal-India relations. It is crucial for Nepal to maintain a strong, healthy, and strict diplomatic position so as to reap the benefits from both its neighbours. Nepal must look out for its best interest in this geopolitical game.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0;\">\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[1] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/10/22/india-intelligence-chief-s-sudden-dash-for-kathmandu-raises-many-an-eyebrow</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[2] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/10/22/india-intelligence-chief-s-sudden-dash-for-kathmandu-raises-many-an-eyebrow</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[3] Observers cautiously optimistic over Indian army chief’s …. https://bipinadhikari.com.np/news/observers-cautiously-optimistic-over-indian-army-chiefs-visit/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[4] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/11/04/observers-cautiously-optimistic-over-indian-army-chief-s-visit</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[5] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/11/11/indian-foreign-secretary-to-visit-nepal-in-sign-of-ties-getting-back-on-track</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[6] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/11/11/indian-foreign-secretary-to-visit-nepal-in-sign-of-ties-getting-back-on-track</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[7] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/11/29/as-kathmandu-plays-host-to-guests-from-south-and-north-concerns-grow-over-geopolitical-games</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha Ghimire', '/uploads/banner_image/1671347422_hands-908165_1280-100x71.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12-04', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:55:22', '2022-12-18 18:55:22'),

Nepali Prime Minister KP Oli made a similar baseless and immature statement on July 13', NULL, '<p>Juvenile remarks from a country’s executive head about a sensitive subject is capable of deteriorating the country’s international standing. Nepali Prime Minister KP Oli made a similar baseless and immature statement on July 13. He claimed that Hindu deity Lord Rama was born in a village named ‘Ayodhya’ which is towards the west of Birgunj. He further asserted that India somehow ‘twisted’ the cultural facts as Oli pondered how King Dashrath must have travelled to Janakpur to marry off his son when there were meagre transport facilities in the ancient time. Oli merely relied on the weak transportation and communication systems to clarify his stance and added that it was ‘impossible’ for King Dashrath to know there was an eligible princess for marriage due to communiqué barriers. According to PM Oli, therefore, the ‘real’ Ayodhya is in Nepal, near Birgunj, and refused to debate further as he sensed ‘one attack after another’.[1]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe following day, there was an uproar across the border as people criticised PM Oli’s unproven remarks. PM Oli touched a sensitive nerve when he spoke about the already religiously controversial Ayodhya and also toyed with Bhartiya Janata Party’s principal ideology based on Hindutva. This naturally angered not only the Hindu Sena but also Hindu supporters across both the countries. Consequently, BJP spokesperson Bizay Sonkar Shastri condemned Oli’s statement and said no one is allowed to play with religious sentiments. Shastri also drew similarities between the left party of India and CPN, highlighting that playing with people’s faith will lead to widespread rejection like India’s left party did.[2] Similarly, Indian netzines took to social media to ridicule PM Oli with anecdotes suggesting that everything originated from Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the uproar, the Nepali foreign Ministry scrambled to do some damage control. The Ministry released a statement on July 14 clarifying PM’s stance and that Oli didn’t mean to hurt any religious sentiments. On the same account, India’s Foreign Ministry refrained from making any statement after receiving clarification from Nepal’s Ministry. However, some experts opined that by then, the bizarre remarks managed to worsen Nepal-India ties at the people level as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKathmandu-Delhi struggles spread amongst the community, primarily affecting the border regions. There was an extreme scenario in Varanasi when a man who claimed to be a Nepali was tonsured and forced to chant anti-Oli slogans by the Vishwa Hindu Sena as a result of Oli’s comments. The President of Hindu Sena, Arun Pathak, shared the video where he forced the man to honour the livelihood opportunities he got in India despite being a Nepali. Pathak also threatened the lives of all Nepalis living in India if Oli doesn’t retract his statement.[3] It was later revealed that the alleged Nepali man was an Indian who was paid Rs 1,000 to orchestrate the event.[4] However, the religious outfit’s intention was apparent as it sent across a message to Oli about his remarks by threatening Nepalis, which could further jeopardise Nepal-India relations. Political and foreign policy experts expressed fear over such political bitterness penetrating in the community and said it’s a matter of ‘great concern’.[5]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOli, who came to power using the ‘ultra-nationalist’ agenda in 2015 after the Indian blockade, is now facing disapproval within his party for his ineffective actions and strategies towards the COVID-19 crisis. Oli accused the party leaders of having aligned with the southern block, after Oli’s government issued the new political map, to ‘remove him from power’.[6] This move exacerbated the situation as leaders became more determined to take Oli down. Internal party dispute was seen percolating in the country’s foreign relations as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOli is visibly growing closer with China and is gambling Nepal-India relations which is clearly against Nepal’s non-alignment foreign policy. Many experts and leaders have urged the government not to distance India but to instead keep both the countries at an equidistance. Nepal-India’s interdependence because of the socio-cultural ties that predate to the 19th century is extremely eminent. Nepal and India don’t only share Delhi-Kathmandu diplomatic relations, but the open border has created a very complex and nuanced border dynamics, which Nepal cannot neglect. People-to-people ties are the foundation of Nepal-India relations, and Hinduism is just a thread that further strengthens it. Therefore, Oli’s cultural encroachment was an insult to this unique dynamic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, Nepal-India relations seem to have reached the lowest point for the first time in history. PM Oli has been provoking India for quite some time now as a series of events suggest the same. Firstly, the unilateral issuance of Nepal’s new political map, which includes the disputed territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura followed by the constitutional amendment to revise the emblem was scorned by India. Secondly, Oli’s remarks about the Indian Coronavirus being more lethal was another aggressive statement. Thirdly, Nepal’s decision to ‘ban’ Indian media channels as it displayed ‘objectionable’ content about a conspiracy with Hou Yanqi, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, also was a provocative move. Finally, the juvenile claim that ‘real’ Ayodhya is in Nepal drew widespread discontent. PM Oli further added that science and knowledge were originated and developed in Nepal. This was analysed as an act of over-glorification of the ‘national identity’[7] and a means to divert people’s attention away from his government’s failure, notably the failed attempt to contain the spread of Coronavirus. Dinesh Bhattarai, former foreign policy adviser and ambassador, added that bilateral relations between Nepal and the southern neighbour has become ‘dangerous’.[8]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, ahead of Oli’s remarks, analysts had already condemned Oli’s foreign policy following the deteriorating relations with India. Experts and opposition party termed Oli’s foreign policy as ‘disarray and disoriented’. Nepali Congress and the Janata Samajbadi Party concluded that Oli government’s foreign policy is decreasing Nepal’s credibility in the international sphere. Besides, the oppositions opined that the ruling NCP’s policy is a double standard.[9] Oli is regularly found baffled in a geopolitical ‘quagmire’ between China, India, and the United States.[10]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith proven electoral success using the ‘anti-India’ narrative in 2015, Oli is now often conveniently seen turning towards it when he feels besieged and is, therefore, vastly responsible for smothering the old cultural ties with India. Oli’s unsubstantiated claim over Ayodhya was just one of his many comments and actions which has pushed India away while strengthening relations with China. India already suspects that Oli has been acting at the ‘behest’ of someone else, pointing to China. Nonetheless, these childish remarks can weigh heavy on Nepal. Nepal must strictly abide by its ‘non-alignment’ foreign policy as both the neighbours are equally important. Only from a balanced relationship with these two neighbouring countries can Nepal take the most advantage, prioritising its national interest. The Nepali Prime Minister must call for a dialogue with India to resolve the much-heated border dispute which might help in some damage control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuthor: Shraddha More</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha More', '/uploads/banner_image/1671347433_thumb-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:55:33', '2022-12-18 18:55:33'),

Over the course of two years as prime minister,', NULL, '<p>Prime Minister K.P Sharma Oli is habitually hyperbolic. It is evident in his speeches that he enjoys making exaggerated comments without any hesitation. Over the course of two years as prime minister, Oli has made various comments that have been topics of discussion, jokes and memes. While it may sound humorous to hear, one has to acknowledge that the comments he makes are as the head of nation. Parliament is markedly different from speaking before party cadres, Members of Parliament generally have specific queries and require focused, evidence-based discussions rather than political speechmaking. Oli often arrives at Parliament with heaps of notes but he doesn’t read off a script and tends to improvise as he goes along. This can lead to the prime minister getting sidetracked for an hour, rambling about something that struck his head rather than what he came to discuss. PM Oli does not need enemies. He has himself. By making statements that are superficial and insensitive, he rubs everyone the wrong way. The Prime Minister does not seem to care what anyone thinks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile addressing a function on July 13 to mark the 207th birth anniversary of national poet Bhanubhakta Acharya, PM Oli accused India of cultural aggression and distorting historical facts. Oli said that Lord Rama was born in Ayodhya, which was near Thori in Nepal’s Birgunj—not in India — and that Rama was a Nepali.[1] There was however, no concrete evidence to back his claim. Oli’s statement garnered quite a response, with leaders from his own ruling party describing it as “uncalled for” and absurd. After that farcical remark, the Foreign Ministry hustled to release a press statement that stated Oli’s remarks were not political and not meant to disrespect Ayodhya and its significance. In a situation where the Nepal – India relation is at a historically low point, the Prime Minister’s insensitive claims have percolated down not just to diplomatic arenas but also to the local level. A purported Nepali man based in Varanasi, was forcibly shaved and forced to chant slogans against PM Oli over the latter’s recent controversial statement on the birthplace of Ram. It is a matter of grave concern, the Prime Minister is thoughtless in his approaches that is resulting in problems not just the diplomatic circuit, but also in general public.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOli’s style of speaking might have been tailor-made for the political circuit, but in Parliament and in a public sphere, it has wasted time and put a damper on the House business. Oli tends to ramble for hours and veer off topic, often resorting to lectures on subjects he personally knows little about. In most cases, Oli is wasting crucial time making unnecessary statements that are baseless. On June 10, Oli got up before the House of Representatives to answer queries on the new budget, but instead, he spent a significant amount of time talking about the coronavirus and the “immunity” of Nepalis. When opposition lawmaker and Nepali Congress leader, Gagan Thapa questioned Oli[2], asking him for the scientific evidence behind his claims, Oli openly ridiculed Thapa, while other party members laughed. Public health experts have categorically denied any medical or scientific basis for Oli’s claims that Nepalis have stronger immune systems. Again, a week later, when he appeared before the National Assembly on June 16, Oli once again want tangent for over two hours and made more unsubstantiated claims[3] about the benefits of turmeric, ginger and garlic and how their consumption would prevent COVID-19. There is, once again, no evidence that turmeric, ginger or garlic ward off COVID-19.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe prime minister, while speaking, needs to understand that he is not just addressing lawmakers but also the citizens and even international observers. The way Oli speaks in Parliament might suit his personality but it doesn’t suit the executive head of state. Oli seems to be guided by the perception that controversial remarks are necessary to command attention. Although that is believed to be true in the political world, when addressing as Prime Minister, one must focus on what they are trying to say. Prime Minister Oli has already committed three blunders in dealing with India. The first mistake was speaking about India’s symbol Satyamev Jayate in an irritant manner, the second mistake is to blame India for hatching conspiracy to topple his government, which is baseless, and thirdly he committed a mistake by claiming that Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Ram lies near Birgunj of Nepal. Therefore, the Prime Minister must be careful about what he says, as the saying goes, ‘Reap what you sow, and speak what you know.’<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAuthor: Prieyanka Neupane; Neupane was a junior research fellow at CESIF Nepal.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671347664_Oli-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-12', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 18:59:24', '2022-12-18 18:59:24'),

Presently, India is reeling under the Covid-19 pandemic and also embroiled in an ongoing standoff with China. Parts of PM Modi’s speech suggested that Indian foreign policy was experiencing a shift based on such regional and global trends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia has appeared to have taken an offensive stance with China, following a trust deficit resulting from skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border in Sikkim and more recently in Ladakh. [1]For instance, according to reports, India has completed the construction of a strategically important bridge over the Galwan River in eastern Ladakh, despite strong opposition to it by the Chinese military. Along with construction of permanent structures such as roads and bridges, India has also deployed new units along the border. [2]Furthermore, in his Independence Day speech, Narendra Modi claimed that the nation’s soldiers had given a befitting reply to those who had tried to threaten the territorial integrity of the nation and that India would continue to fight against any and all attempts of expansionism. These developments suggest that India has adopted an assertive position, at least on border issues with China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn efforts to modernize its military, India has gradually become one of the world’s biggest arms importer. More recently, India has purchased 36 Rafale fighter jets from a French manufacturer. The first five of these jets landed in the country on July 29 in the midst of a border face off against China. PM Modi welcomed the arrival of the fighter jets and tweeted, “There is no sacrifice like the national defense; there is no good deed like the national defense; there is no practice like national defense”. [3]The Indian Air Force lags behind China both qualitatively and quantitatively and faces the challenge of mustering enough aircraft to tackle any possible collusion. Although the fleet of 36 Rafale aircrafts may not dramatically alter the balance of power in the region, it has certainly provided a boost to Indian military capability as well as morale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmidst criticism that India has lost influence in its neighborhood, India has increased its engagement in the South Asia which can be observed in its recent conduct of diplomacy in the region. [4]For Modi, the development of India’s East and Northeast is a top priority and a strategic imperative which requires better integration with Bangladesh. The Indian foreign secretary visited Dhaka and conveyed Bangladesh’s privileged position in Indian foreign policy matrix. The Sri Lankan foreign secretary also announced that while Sri Lanka will maintain neutrality when dealing with regional and global powers like China and continue to cooperate with them on the economic front, it will adopt a strategic security-wise ‘India first’ policy. [5]Furthermore, in his speech, Modi also made an appeal to strengthen cooperation with not only India’s neighbors connected by land and sea but also countries with whom India shares harmonious relationships. India has asserted strategic autonomy in all international partnerships, however, mounting tensions with China has prompted India to have a change of heart. [6]For instance, India has been warming to the ‘Quad’ and the Indo-Pacific concepts for military cooperation in the Indian Ocean. These developments certainly suggest a turning point in India’s conduct of foreign policy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the heart of Indian foreign policy and development assistance is the principle of “vasudhaiva kutumbakam” or “the world is one family”. [7]The Covid-19 pandemic has seen this principle in action as India has been providing assistance to thousands of foreign citizens stranded abroad, assembling rapid response and medical assistance teams, and sending medical, food and other essential supplies to countries that have been hit the hardest by the virus. As a matter of fact, India was a first responder to countries in the Indo-pacific such as Maldives and Sri Lanka and sent teams of doctors along with essential medical supplies. [8]Furthermore, India has drawn up a medical assistance plan of Rs 1 billion in an attempt to scale up India’s diplomatic outreach to over 90 countries. Although the plan has not yet been formalized, India’s Covid-19 diplomacy has caught the world’s attention.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the ongoing strife with China, India has also shown openness to resolve outstanding issues through diplomacy and cooperation. Indian and Chinese counterparts have constantly communicated since May at various levels as the de-escalation process in Ladakh moves forward in what is being called a ‘phased manner’. Furthermore, India is set to attend the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) to be held in Moscow in September. [9]According to reports, Ahead of this SCO meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will chair a large-format meeting of BRICS Foreign Ministers via videoconference on September 4 which will include both India and China. The two feuding Asian giants are thus set to engage in a hectic diplomatic dialogue facilitated by Russian interlocutors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would be premature to say that there has been a major shift in India’s foreign policy. However, over the past month and half, there has been a shift in India’s willingness to more actively engage in the neighborhood and beyond. Furthermore, despite India adopting a more offensive position with China on border issues, keeping economic benefits and development in mind, it has shown a willingness reach a resolve with China via Russian meditation. The Covid-19 crisis has also given India an opportunity to leverage its image and reputation as a trusted, neutral and credible development partner in the post-pandemic world.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671347911_Oli_Modi-100x70.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-26', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 19:03:31', '2022-12-18 19:03:31'),

While the Prime Minister boasts of ‘Happy Nepali, Prosperous Nepal,’ the visionless ideas of the incompetent', NULL, '<p>August Analysis<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCorruption has been widespread in Nepal. There is virtually no sector in Nepal that is free from this ailment. While the Prime Minister boasts of ‘Happy Nepali, Prosperous Nepal,’ the visionless ideas of the incompetent government have only shattered the hopes of the ‘happy Nepali’. The scale of corruption in the country has only gone from bad to worse, over the course of two years that KP Oli has taken office. The government has time and again said that it has adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption but there have been several contradictions to that statement. The incompetency of the government to control and eradicate corruption has only been maintained to push people out of positions only to appoint someone equally or far more corrupt in nature.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo begin with, there are several legal tools in place that have been designed to prevent corruption and other irregularities. The CIAA has reported several arrests of people in positions over corruption charges. At a press conference in January CIAA spokesperson, Pradeep Kumar Koirala has appreciated ‘the great achievements’[1] of CIAA by busting several corruption cases by using sting tactics. However, in several of those cases the court has ruled out on the decision of corruption because CIAA has been found to be working under the behest of special interest groups. CIAA is a powerful institutional body that is given responsibility to control graft in the government to ensure a good governance. But CIAA has been found taking sides while they trap small fishes but let the big ones free. CIAA is not going after people who are involved in tax evasion. Around 200 firms have been found in faking VAT bills[2] worth Rs 15 billion but the CIAA is happy to trap small cases of bribery. None of the big scams of high-profile cases like the Airbus deal, Ncell tax or the Yeti Holdings have been investigated. This only portrays that the CIAA, the only anti-graft body in the country has sidelined larger issues of corruption making the CIAA ironically, a corrupt body too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to that, in a recent event, The Metropolitan Police Circle in Durbarmarg was found to be faking an incident involving 14 kilograms of gold. While it was said by the APF that a suspected car was followed after the police were tipped, to be carrying a huge amount of gold. Later the car threw the yellow metal and some weapons from a moving vehicle only to have the Nepal Police get busy collecting the gold thrown on the roads of Kamaladi, as it was said. The police did not nab the car. Later when the case was analyzed there was no CCTV evidence that the Durbarmarg Police seized the ‘gold’ from Kamaladi area. It was later investigated by another division only to find that the Police involved in nabbing the people in the car, did not even contact their Division to take the vehicle under control. Such instances make people doubt the authenticity of the entire Police Force. The people entrust the police force to control and manage any suspicious situations but if the police are creating false stories, it only shows the incompetency of the whole Police Force.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the 57th Annual Report[3] by the office of the Auditor General, it has been stated that the minister and high-level authorities have been misusing state fund in pretext of maintaining law and order. Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa and former home secretary have been found to be releasing and spending Rs 7.2 and Rs 7.3 million of funds respectively from the state coffers, the report states. The reason for this extravagant expenditure seems to be unclear only to reiterate the fact that these funds might have been corrupted by the officials. The same report also indicated that the ministry of Home Affairs was found to be distributing large amounts as medical expenses and financial relief. The office of Auditor General has recommended the government to control such embezzlement off state funds and develop clear guidelines for transparency. This kind off spending causes the nation great financial loss. It also questions the moralities of our leadership.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, controversial political appointments of people who fuel corruption have been rampant. In a recent event, the government decided to appoint[4] Upendra Kumar Koirala as the chairperson of Rastriya Banijya Bank. Koirala has been known to have ties with the Deputy Minister Ishwar Pokharel has already worked in various government bodies as a political appointee. He has been accused of involvement in embezzlement and corruption several times during his previous appointments. Appointment of such personalities only reinforces corruption. More often than not such corrupt people also escape punishment on paltry bail. The person accused of corruption have avoided harsh punishments without or negligible bail. The demand of payment of paltry, negligible bails, have only been factors that encourage corruption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe evidence of failure of the government has been perceptible in its inability to tackle COVID -19 cases too. From the beginning of the pandemic in the country, the government was engulfed in corruption of procuring medical kits, preparing quarantine facilities and accommodation and other important facilities that counter the effects of a pandemic. To add to that, the government imposed an abrupt a four-month long lockdown on March 23, 2020. During the lockdown, the government should have prepared to set up quarantine and isolation facilities, COVID-dedicated infrastructure, training frontline health workers and expanding tests. The government should have prepared itself to upgrade the health infrastructure during the lockdown, but instead the lockdown was lifted on July 21, 2020, as abruptly as it was imposed. Four months of lockdown and a re-shutdown has drained the country’s economy. While the health impact is an important concern, a prolonged lockdown will damage the economy for a long time. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has estimated that it would take at least nine months after the lockdown is fully lifted for the economy to come back to where it was[5]. NRB has studied that in the past five months of lockdown, a total of 22.5%[6] of those employed have lost jobs. Tourism and aviation sector have been hit the hardest, where revenue has been almost zero in the past five months. Businesses have been equally hit. Businesses that have taken loan from banks are not in a position to repay even the interests, let alone the capital, because transactions have been close to none. The government has remained mum even through all of this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCorruption is rife and large scandals are pushed under the rug. Investigations are being pursed slowly. The corruption in various bodies of the state only weakens the nation. In a developing country like Nepal, the lack of a strong leadership and transparency makes it difficult to implement good governance thus fueling the fire corruption needs. The procurement of health supplies, delay in test results, and failure to provide adequate support to its people are only some issues that brings forth the current government’s incompetency. The CIAA’s inability to charge larger cases that affect the good governance only portrays the government in a negative light. The public frustration towards the government’s inability to control corruption is rising. The COVID-19 crisis has brought forth and amplified a number of the government’s long-standing weaknesses like corruption, poor preparation to any given situation, and negligence to provide employment opportunities to those that have returned back to the nation. It has also magnified the incompetency of our Health Ministry proving how our healthcare system is under-resourced. The government has miserably failed to provide a firm foundation to the people that voted it into power. As people of the nation we should be more vigilant and watch the government more carefully than ever to ensure transparency.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671348094_word-cloud-3269304_1280-100x69.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-26', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 19:06:34', '2022-12-18 19:06:34');

A task force formed by the Nepal government to identify/gather evidence and suggest a strategy on border dispute submitted its report after three months listing evidences and recommending that Nepal engage in talks with India to reclaim the territory.[1] In the meantime, Nepal has also started studying India’s proposal to connect Kathmandu with a railway line from Raxaul. India has asked Konkan Railway Corporation to carry out a Detailed Project Report.[2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PM Oli rejigged his cabinet on October 15, removing Minister Ishwar Pokhrel from the Defence Ministry to the Office of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. He kept the Ministry of Defence for himself.[3] The move, which came on the eve of Indian Army’s Chief of Staff General MM Naravane’s visit to Nepal, was interpreted by Indian observers as an attempt to appease India as Minister Pokhrel had been critical of India and the Indian Army.[4] In addition, there were growing difference between the Nepali Army and Minister Ishwar Pokhrel in recent months and the rejig was an indication that PM Oli was listening more to the concerns of the Nepali Army rather than his own minister. Defence Minister Ishwar Pokhrel was removed from his defence portfolio on the eve of Naravane’s visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On October 21, Samant Kumar Goel, chief of India’s Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), visited Nepal on October 21 and held dialogue with Prime Minister K P Oli. Politicians and observers criticized Prime Minister Oli for meeting with India’s intelligence chief to restart political dialogue; the meeting allowed PM Oli’s detractors within the party to attack him.[5] Both India and China have engaged in visible and well publicized events as they hold talks with Nepali political leaders, indicating that they may as well be sending a message to each other. In particular, a faction of the NCP, led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Pushpa Kamal Dahal have remained close to China in recent months. Dahal was particularly critical of Goel’s visit as he was not informed about it.[6] A few days later, the Vijaya Dashami greeting issued by PM Oli contained a map of Nepal without the new claimed border areas in Kalapani, which was seen as another evidence of PM Oli’s attempts to apepase India.[7]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were discussions in Nepal around why India had chosen an intelligence chief as its special envoy and whether the Indian government had handed over its Nepal policy to the RAW.[8] In any case, given the history of RAW’s role in Nepal, his meeting with Nepal’s Prime Minister did not go well with the Nepali public and degraded PM Oli’s image. In its editorial, The Hindustan Times noted that while Goel’s visit demonstrates RAW’s clout in Nepal and the Indian government’s decision to engage with PM Oli, “New Delhi must be careful that “normalcy” in ties should not come at the cost of narrowing down its interests in Nepal.” It added that “only a stable, inclusive, democratic Nepal—led by a regime which knows the value of special ties with India and engages with China within certain boundaries—can help keep the regional security environment balanced.”[9]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chief of Army Staff Indian Army, General MM Naravane, visited Nepal on November 3 and was bestowed with the highest honours, almost erasing the bitterness generated by his comments regarding China and Nepal in May 2020.[10] The military of the two countries have, from time to time, helped mediate dialogue and channel communications when formal political relations between the two countries have broken down. Indian foreign secretary Harsh Singhla is likely to follow General Naravane and resume dialogue on border disputes through the Joint Technical Level Boundary Committee. Although India opened its border with Nepal on October 22, the Nepal side will open it only on November 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal-China</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s relations with China has not been very smooth in recent months. There’s been lack of progress in pursuing agreements with China, differences on trade and transit, and even border disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s agreements with China, signed during President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal in October 2019, are in limbo despite efforts by the two sides to push forward the projects.[11] Now questions are being raised whether the delays are due to Covid-19 and bureaucratic hurdles or cooling down of political interest. Prime Minister KP Oli’s behavior in recent months indicate that the reason may be more political as pro-Chinese forces inside the NCP have now grouped against him and are criticising him for promoting the interests of India and the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Nepal’s linkage to China has suffered as a result of China showing reluctance to fully operate the main transit points in Gyirong and Tatopani. There are also issues about trade. Nepal has been seeking concessions for export of about 512 goods to China since the 1980s, China is still to consider Nepal’s request. China has been offering concessions to about 8000 goods, but Nepal does not have comparative advantage on goods from this list. On the contrary, China has been enjoying exponential growth in exports to Nepal in the last several years.[12]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, some local and political representatives from Humla have been raising questions over China’s encroachment of Nepali border, Nepal’s government officials[13] and the Chinese are insisting that no such encroachment has taken place.[14] Chinese media has been making the issue personal by bringing in the Nepali Congress and MP Jiwan Bahadur Shahi, for spreading “fabricated” reports.[15] While NC has claimed that China has indeed encroached Nepali territory[16], Shahi has pushed back by outlining evidences and challenging China to back its claim with evidence.[17] The stance by MPs like Jiwan Bahadur Shahi raises the prospect that Nepal government may be trying to protect Chinese interests rather than protecting its own national interests, while pro-Chinese sections in Nepal are claiming that it is an attempt by western and pro-Indian forces to contain China in Nepal. India’s view is that China is trying to limit India’s influence in Nepal and expanding operations close to the Nepal-India border by procuring huge amounts of land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India and the US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s cooling down of relations with China comes on the heel of increased pressure from India and the US. On October 25-26, India and the US held a two-plus-two ministerial meeting, forging an understanding for institutionalised intelligence sharing arrangement and cooperation on unmanned underwater and space platforms called Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA).[18]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the meeting two sides also discussed China’s “aggression” in Ladakh, peace in Afghanistan and terror in Pakistan. The Joint Statement on the Third U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue said the two countries intend to expand cooperation under the Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership forged during US President Donald Trump’s visit to India on February 20, 2020. The joint statement talked about cooperation during the COVID-19 pandemic; shared vision for the Indo-Pacific and global leadership; advancing the defense and security partnership; strengthening bilateral U.S.-India cooperation; and nurturing people–to-people bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India held the first of two phase the annual naval exercise in Malabar from November 3-6, which marked the “strategic convergence” of the Quad—India, US, Japan and Australia. The next exercise will be held on November 17-20. The stated objective of the exercise is to maintain secure and open sea lanes and perceive Chinese Navy as a threat. Australia took part in the exercise after a gap of 13 years. China criticized the Quad as a “huge security risk” and has tried to push back against recent US moves to forge strategic alliances in the South and East Asian region through various means.[19]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Columnists in the Global Times questioned the extent of US backing and said India-China relations was already sour and the US incitement was unlikely to further dampen the ties. Despite several rounds of talks, India and China continue to bolster their military capability at the border points. Indian experts are upbeat about continuation of US-India relations after transition of power in the US despite the existence of several irritants. The primary points of contention between Indi and the US are, India’s defence purchases from Russia, India’s ties with Iran, US position on domestic social and human rights issues, and differences in trade.[20] According to US officials, partnership between US and India is based on “shared security and geopolitical goals, shared interests, and shared values.”[21]</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style:

The three-month-long lockdown period should ideally have been the time to prepare isolation wards, adequate health services and facilities, increase the number of PCR tests, prenatal care homes, quarantine facilities, and more. However, the government lagged behind in taking any relevant measures, pushing the country into a state of uncertainty and insecurity. The decision to ease the lockdown without any protocol further triggered an increase in the number of cases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGovernment’s bubble and the burst<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government’s claim that the virus transmission had come under control was an illusion. Furthermore, lifting the lockdown on the same account was another blunder. The reduction in testing prompted this illusion and the subsequent decision to lift the lockdown. However, when the government realized that the transmission risk was too high after Birgunj became the hotspot, it was already too late. The graph below represents the trend in the national Coronavirus cases and the number of PCR tests conducted. As the tests performed increased, the cases have also visibly increased.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn July 31, total reported infections stood at 19,771, and the death toll was at 56.[1] But soon the transmission kicked in, taking the national toll to 34,418 cases with 175 reported deaths[2] within<br />\r\n<br />\r\nevidently increased the number of testing, and on August 26, 2% of the population had undergone PCR tests. Till July 31, only 375,416 PCR tests were performed which ballooned to 635,252 PCR tests, almost increased by two folds in August alone. Similarly, the death toll trend can be seen in the graph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy was there a sudden increase in the cases?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the decision to ease the lockdown on June 21, there was a heavy flow in the number of people entering Nepal illegally through the southern border. The uncalculated move by the government resulted in a rapid increase of cases in the Terai region which soon penetrated into Kathmandu valley, causing the national infections and death toll to surge.[3] The rise in the number of cases is primarily attributed to the negligence of the government. Failing to understand the gravity of the situation was the biggest catastrophe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGovernment initiative to control it<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNonetheless, the government again imposed a lockdown and further prohibitory orders in districts and municipalities where cases are swelling. Similarly, capital city Kathmandu valley is also under lockdown. The local government further mandated the hospitals and private medical institutions to reserve 20% of beds for Coronavirus patients. These restrictions and last resort attempts indicate towards the desperate struggle to curb the rising number of cases. However, the private hospitals have expressed reservations by stating that it is impossible to allocate as per government directive. The government had initially directed 1,000 additional beds and 100 ICUs but the private sector has revealed that it can only manage up to 500 beds and 60 ICUs.[4]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe much-awaited vaccine<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs nations worldwide are struggling to contain the spread internally, there is also a global race to develop and roll out the Coronavirus vaccine before any other government does. It is in the best interest of all the nations to cooperate and develop the vaccine as quickly as possible, but world politics is much complicated. The US-China rivalry may instigate the countries not to share and collaborate if one develops the antidote first. Similarly, the competition and conflict amongst the countries create a “vicious” circle. Currently, China, India, Britain, Russia, and America are the major countries in this rat race.[5] According to the World Health Organization, over 165 vaccines are being developed while 32 are in the human trial stage.[6]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat does this mean for Nepal?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsequently, the main concern for Nepal is where it stands in receiving the vaccines being discovered. Russia and China have already committed to Nepal to provide the vaccine, while the southern neighbour, India, has prioritized Bangladesh.[7]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s health ministry has sanctioned to perform Phase III clinical trials of the vaccine. Phase III refers to the trial where thousands of people are inoculated, and the scientists observe how many people have relapsed or recovered from the virus. At least 50% of the people have to show positive recovery for the vaccine to be declared effective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWay forward for Nepal<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ministry has directed the Nepal Health Research Council to approve the companies which have fulfilled all necessary procedures and guidelines to move into Phase III trial. Furthermore, public health experts have requested the government to study the authenticity of the vaccines before giving a green signal for the trial. The companies attempting to inoculate Nepalis must have a local authority who would be held accountable for any adverse-effect scenario. Further, the participants who will undergo the trial must be insured and sign a consent form according to Nepal’s guidelines. However, the set of protocols for the trial hasn’t been established yet and may take up to four weeks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to experts, the clauses to enable these trials must include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>a guarantee that Nepal will be on the priority list if the attempt is successful and</li>\r\n	<li>a guarantee that Nepal will be on the priority list if the attempt is successful and</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia has already offered its vaccine, Sputnik-V, to Nepal and is ready to conduct the phase III trial. Moreover, Hongshi Shivam Cement has also sought permission to inoculate 1,000 employees who would undergo the Chinese vaccine trial.[8] Additionally, the international vaccine alliance, GAVI, has promised that Nepal amongst 92 other low-income countries will receive the Coronavirus vaccine at the same time as the wealthier nations do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe stigma attached to the trial<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile people express reservations to undergo such trials, it is a significant step to examine the credibility and validity of the vaccine. Dr Anup Subedee, an infectious disease expert, expressed that if the clinical trials are being conducted worldwide, Nepal mustn’t “hesitate”.[9] The government’s decision to invite the trial was encouraged by health experts, but the government must also be cautious of the stigma and rumours that have been going around about COVID-19.[10]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe concerned authorities must be responsible and accountable for conveying complete knowledge about the process, risks, objective, side-effects and other relevant information to the communities which are interested in participating in the trial. The citizens must not misunderstand that undergoing the Phase III trial will make them a “guinea pig”, but instead must perceive it as a step towards developing the vaccine for the lethal virus. Like mentioned earlier, it is a crucial phase of the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditional shortcomings</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are a few other shortcomings which the government still needs to address:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The private PCR tests are currently priced extremely high and cannot be afforded by the underprivileged.</li>\r\n	<li>The uneven distribution of the health facilities concentrated in urban areas has been another significant drawback.</li>\r\n	<li>The health and medical facilities are running short on the primary health equipment such as mask and PPE kits for the health workers.</li>\r\n	<li>Health workers across 150 hospitals have been infected, and the people are nervous about undergoing contact tracing due to the stigma attached to it and fear of being isolated.</li>\r\n	<li>Inadequate prenatal facilities has triggered a series of additional difficulties. The government airlifted around 200 pregnant women from rural areas; however, airlifting is not a solution.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmid the rising number of cases, and shortage of isolations wards, adequate treatment facilities, mismanagement of quarantine facilities, and other shortcomings, the vaccine trial permission was a strong and required move. But this decision alone is insufficient; the government needs to ramp up tests and provide relief packages. Furthermore, the permission for vaccine trial may also be viewed as a populist agenda to overshadow other inadequacies. Nonetheless, the citizens are hopeful that these companies which will conduct the trial will prioritize Nepal while distributing the vaccine. Lockdown is not the solution to the rising number of cases, but building an appropriate response team and measures is the key. Lockdown will do worse than good to the economy, and the government has already failed once</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha More', '/uploads/banner_image/1671349184_coronavirus-4833616_1280-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-26', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 19:24:44', '2022-12-18 19:24:44'),

With about six months until the allocated date and despite an increasingly perturbing pandemic, NC leaders have begun their preparation in a rather aggressive manner. This includes party president Sher Bahadur Deuba ‘unilaterally’ forming new departments and appointing people close to him, allegedly to influence the upcoming convention.[1] Meanwhile, his rivals claim that the national mood is in favor of a leadership change[2] and, therefore, Deuba should step down and make way for other leaders in line to head the party. Several second and third-generation NC leaders have been eyeing for the president’s post. Even Deuba’s longtime confidant, Bimalendra Nidhi, recently announced his intention to run for party president. With Deuba adamant on heading the party for one more term and several other NC leaders on putting a new face to the party, the ongoing intra-party tussle for president’s candidacy has been a curious spectacle because it has grave implication for the party and Nepal’s overall democracy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFactions and Candidates<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepali Congress has three main factions—led by NC president Sher Bahadur Deuba and senior leaders Ram Chandra Poudel and Krishna Prasad Situala. Eyeing for the post of party president or using the candidacy for political bargains are some 11 leaders from the three factions.[3] While Ram Chandra Poudel, Dr. Shashank Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Dr. Ramsharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Dr. Shekhar Koirala have all hinted or announced to run for president, Krishna Prasad Situala and Gagan Thapa, from the other faction, have both been speculated as likely candidates. From the Deuba faction too, Bimalendra Nidhi has announced that he will run for president. At the same time, Deuba seems reluctant to step down, and Gopal Man Shrestha silently wishes to claim the candidacy himself if Deuba decides to step aside.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe scattered voices of these leaders within the same faction demonstrate their personal ambitions and interests. They are using the opportunity for political bargains to either improve their status within the party or to get their home constituency ready for the general election. For instance, Prakash Man Singh’s narrow victory and Bimalendra Nidhi’s loss in the 2017 election show their precarious position in their respective constituencies; the general convention and even the political bargain they can milk out of the pre-convention situation will significantly influence their hold among the voters. On the other hand, Gagan Thapa has his eyes set on the party’s general secretary; his claim for presidential candidacy only paves a way to that goal of his.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Poudel faction presents the most interesting of these intra-faction struggles. While Poudel, who ran against Deuba in the 13th general convention, wants to contend himself, late NC veteran leader BP Koirala’s son Dr. Shashank Koirala has geared up his activities. He even claims that nobody except him can defeat Deuba and, therefore, he should be running against him. His cousin Dr. Shekhar Koirala, who also claims presidential candidacy, thinks Dr. Shashank should step aside and support him this time, as he did so in the 13th convention and made way for him to be the party’s general secretary. Others from the Poudel Group seem relatively less serious for the candidacy. However, all these leaders, including Gagan Thapa and other new generation leaders, share a resolution to replace Deuba with a fresh face. This anti-Deuba determination and their likelihood to unseat Deuba in the convention are the only tools they have been using to claim their candidacy; the battle for the presidency is not an ideological one, but rather a person-centric scuffle of careerist leaders. President Deuba has been cashing in on this lack of ideological clarity and distinctiveness among the leaders, claims political analyst Dr. Chandra Dev Bhatta. Indeed, Deuba understands that the leaders so focused on removing him do not have an ideological advantage over him and that they are all the same with nothing new to offer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNidhi for President<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most surprising turn of events in NC’s current politics is Bimalendra Nidhi’s announcement that he will run for president—with Deuba’s support. However, Deuba seems certain that Nidhi will not run against him.[4] Whether Nidhi is serious about his candidacy or is merely exploiting the situation to strengthen himself within the party and his constituency remains to be seen. However, if Nidhi does decide to run, it will cause a severe reshuffle in the existing party equation. Nidhi has been Deuba’s right hand for about two decades. Even when Deuba split from the NC and formed NC–Democratic, Nidhi showed him his unwavering support. So for him to claim presidency despite Deuba’s strong determination for himself puts Deuba in a challenging situation. “Most likely, Deuba will himself run for president, but if he is somehow cornered in the party, he will support Dr. Shashank Koirala,” says Dr. Bhatta. Speculations are that he will negotiate the party’s general secretary post for his wife Aarzoo Deuba if he does not run.[5] Therefore, Nidhi’s candidacy would completely dismantle the existing factions, which also means that there may be four presidential candidates—Deuba-backed Shashank Koirala, Sitaula- and Singh-backed Bimalendra Nidhi, Ram Chandra Poudel, and Dr. Shekhar Koirala.[6]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany see Nidhi’s candidacy as a positive step for both Nidhi and the democratic Nepali Congress. If Deuba does not support Nidhi in his party president’s journey, the almost two-decade-long Deuba-Nidhi partnership will come to an end. This would guarantee Deuba’s decline in the party and, consequently, the largest NC faction’s demise. Even if it does not end petty factional politics within Nepali Congress, the resulting reorientation, reorganization, and changed leadership may give a new life to the party. Besides, Nidhi’s strong advocacy for federalism, secularism and inclusion are so essential to counter the communist’s populist nationalism that Nidhi’s presidency may offer NC, a strong weapon in the upcoming election. After all, these elements are central to democracy, which is being undermined by the communist government. Therefore, Nepal’s democratic future does depend on NC’s performance in the general election and, by extension, on this general convention. Apart from choosing the right candidate for the presidency, however, the party will have to demonstrate an ideological clarity whether they still represent BP’s socialism or something new. They will also have to adopt a clear vision for Madhes—their electoral base.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepali Congress and Madhes<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitically, Madhes has been a fertile ground that has yielded generous support to Nepali Congress. In recent years, however, the party’s performance in the region has declined dramatically owing to the party’s lack of vision for Madhes and Madhesi people at a time when political consciousness gave rise to Madhes-based political parties and identity-based politics. Nepali Congress not could catch up neither was it able to coopt and keep influential Madhesi leaders within the party. As a result, leaders like Mahantha Thakur, Jay Prakash Gupta, and Bijaya Gachchhadar defected.[7] The only prominent Madhesi leader who stayed was late NC leader Mahendra Narayan Nidhi’s son, Bimalendra Nidhi. So, in simple words, Nepali congress could neither preserve the faces of Madhes within the party nor fight hard enough for the issues Madhesi people considered necessary. Instead, the party busied itself competing with the communists and merely reacting to their populist agendas such as anti-India nationalism. This trend was evident in recent months when PM led the constitutional amendment, introduced a controversial citizenship bill, and made provocative undiplomatic comments to divert public attention from his government’s miserable failure. The presence of the opposition Nepali Congress was barely felt in any of these episodes. The already dissatisfied Madhesi people have taken note of NC’s silence in issues as important as citizenship, India-Nepal border and relationship, and Hinduism, all of which affect them disproportionately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgainst this backdrop, therefore, even Nidhi’s candidacy and presidency may not prove enough to court the Madhesi people unless the party has a clear vision for the region and the people there. After all, Nidhi was defeated by the Rastriya Janata Party’s leader Rajendra Mahato in his home constituency in 2017. While the hype of the Madhes movement and Madhesi leaders’ popularity may have waned, the disgruntled Madhesi people are now conscious enough not to be lured by mere talks—even of the Madhes-based parties and the leaders. Whether Nepali Congress exploits this situation or becomes a victim to it depends on the party’s preparations. It may require more than a mere Madhesi face; they will have to decentralize Madhesi leadership. It will be possible to do so when/if the Janata Samajwadi Party-Nepal (JSPN) splits and the democratic leaders from JSPN appeal to their voters’ base in favor of the democratic Nepali Congress, claims Dr. Bhatta. Nidhi’s presidency might cause an emotional impetus for the Madhesi people to vote for Nepali Congress, as he would make the first-ever Madhesi prime minister if he won. However, for the party to win a general election against the communists, the candidates should roll out more transparent ideologies and agendas they bring to the table from now onwards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitical analyst CK Lal claims, “What is now remaining of NC in Madhes is ancestral party lineage.”[8] For the region that is so crucial to a party’s overall performance, this is a pity. What is worse is the leaders’ careerist ambitions that prioritize personal benefits over the party’s future. The ongoing battle for the presidency manifests the same sorry state of the party. No leader’s candidacy rests upon an ideological or positional distinctiveness. Dr. Shashank Koirala does come with the agenda of Nepal as a Hindu state. Keeping aside its implication for the democratic party and overall Nepal, whether Dr. Koirala is serious about it is yet to be seen. The only leader who has a strong response to Dr. Koirala is Nidhi, who has always stood as an advocate of democratic principles such as federalism, inclusion, and secularism. Besides that, what sets Poudel apart from Deuba, or what sets Sitaula apart from Singh and Koiralas remains ominously unclear, almost as unclear as NC’s future.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Mahesh Kumar Kushwaha', '/uploads/banner_image/1671353410_democracy-100x71.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-11', '2020-11-26', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 20:35:10', '2022-12-18 20:35:10');

Even the party’s General Secretary and current Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel publicly stated that the party’s unity is under threat.[2] Realizing the gravity of the situation, top leaders from both Oli and Dahal-Nepal faction have been working actively to try and hatch a truce between the two heads.[3][4] Central Committee members are also on their feet again, cautioning the leaders against a party split.[5] In a bid to save the party unity, President Bidhya Devi Bhandari met NCP’s deputy chair Bamdev Gautam and requested him to play his role, like in the past, to help save the unity.[6] However, Dahal, backed by senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, has displayed an irreparable distrust in Oli, while the PM continues to reaffirm that he will not step down as prime minister at any cost.[7] The growing disparity between the two party chairs and NCP’s internal power struggle requires a revisit in the light of most recent developments, which include Oli’s threat of a ‘big action.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old Wound, New Bruises</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ruling party has had internal challenges since the two parties, NCP—Unified Marxist Leninists (NCP—UML) and NCP—Maoist Centre (NCP—MC), unified to form Nepal Communist Party. Famously known as a mere ‘marriage of convenience,’[9] the party has failed to come up with a workable ideology and manage the top leadership. The absence of ideological clarity, leadership mismanagement, and PM Oli’s strong headedness have constantly caused a battle of egos between Oli and Dahal, who finds himself sidelined and his role in the party reduced. Victims of PM Oli’s slyness and tyranny, other leaders, including Madhav Kumar Nepal, Bamdev Gautam, and Jhalanath Khanal, have simply served as Dahal’s important knights in the tussle. As a masterful player himself, though, Oli has successfully dodged all the attacks directed at him so far. For instance, an aggressive call for his resignation as the prime minister and party’s chair and months-long negotiations culminated in a Standing Committee decision on September 11, 2020, which merely allocated Oli’s role as the prime minister (for five years) and Dahal’s as the party’s ‘executive chief.’ In less than two months, however, the truce has gone out of the window, and the party seems to be standing at a more critical juncture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the underlying differences and grievances between Oli and Dahal, NCP’s most recent crisis stems from Dahal’s perception that Oli has violated Standing Committee’s September 11 decision. The perceived violations were seen during the PM’s ambassadorial appointments, cabinet reshuffle, intervention in provincial government of Karnali, and Oli’s meeting with India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Samant Kumar Goel.[10] The September 11 standing meeting had assigned the government’s and party’s responsibility to Oli and Dahal, respectively. It had also stipulated federal cabinet reshuffle, change in the provincial government, political appointments based on proper party criteria and methods, finalizing party unity, and starting preparation for the general convention.[11] However, neither Oli nor Dahal could bring each other (and Nepal) in confidence while executing these actions. Instead, both began a series of accusations aimed at each other; while Dahal accuses Oli of overlooking the party’s decision and making decisions unilaterally, Oli maintains that Dahal always obstructs the government’s performance instead of handling his party responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, on October 1, Oli’s cabinet recommended Yubaraj Khatiwada and Lok Darshan Regmi as ambassadors to the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. Similarly, the cabinet also appointed Shankar Das Bairagi as chief secretary and Nirmal Kumar Bishwakarma as ambassador to South Africa.[12] Reportedly, these political appointments did not occur after any consultation with or approval of either the party or the ‘executive chief’ Dahal. Oli’s move was crucial and the first in a row to upset Dahal, Nepal, and other leaders who would have liked to at least participate in the process. After all, these specific appointments are lucrative and carry a significant political weight, which means leaders usually like to influence such recommendations. However, in his usual manner, Oli decided to bypass the party and made the decision unilaterally, lighting the first match to the current dispute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second move that steered the party towards the ongoing crisis was Oli’s intervention in Karnali’s provincial politics. PM Oli tried to change Karnali’s government by staging a vote of no-confidence against CM Mahendra Bahadur Shahi, a Dahal’s confidante.[13] In the province-level politics that soon gained national attention and saw the interference of the federal government and the ruling party, Nepal and Dahal joined hands, which led to the neutralization of the motion after Nepal-backed provincial lawmakers backtracked. The episode saw an Oli-Dahal divide in that the two chiefs issued two different press notes on the dispute: while Oli directed the CM to reinstate Gulab Jung Shah as the chief whip, Dahal instructed that all disputes be solved at the provincial level.[14] Amid of the ongoing dispute, CM Shahi negotiated with pro-Nepal leaders for a cabinet reshuffle to oust the two pro-Oli ministers from the provincial cabinet.[15] However, when Oli realized the growing Dahal-Nepal alliance at the provincial level and threatened the Dahal-Nepal faction of a ‘big action,’[16] CM Shahi halted the reshuffle.[17] In fact, Oli’s fear of being alienated and his defensive threat of ‘big action’ has startled NCP and opposition leaders alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst NCP’s internal politics and power struggle in regards to altering provincial governments, PM Oli reshuffled the federal cabinet and filled three ministries with people close to him.[18] The move particularly upset Nepal, who had wished to send Surendra Pandey and Beduram Bhusal to the cabinet. With only two of his people in the cabinet—Ghanashyam Bhusal and Yogesh Bhattarai—Nepal has constantly expressed his discontent with Oli, who has periodically betrayed his trust. Despite claims of an extensive cabinet reshuffle after Tihar, Dahal-Nepal and other leaders from the anti-Oli camp saw this move as yet another instance of Oli’s disregard for the September 11 standing committee decision. To them, Oli had begun acting unilaterally again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What exacerbated the already heated dispute within the party was PM Oli’s meeting with the RAW chief Goel. Although the Finance Minister cleared that Goel’s visit was procedural, approved by the Ministry of Finance, anti-Oli leaders interpreted the meeting with cynical eyes and called it undiplomatic. They played up Oli’s nationalist image and accused him of being a hypocrite for meeting Goel, an intelligence chief. Similarly, a clash between two factions of the NCP that killed a cadre in Parsa and the subsequent government negligence caused a further rift in the party. These few events have resurfaced an anti-Oli struggle within the party. PM Oli, on the other hand, accuses the agitating group of being a constant obstacle to the government and has threatened to take a ‘big action’ if they continue to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Would the PM’s Big Action?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaders, experts, and political analysts have begun examining what Oli’s ‘big action’ could be. While he has already hinted at splitting the party, one of his big steps could be to split the party himself. However, as he does not have the required 40% vote in both the Central Committee and Parliamentary Party, he could introduce a new ordinance as he did in the past. A new provision that requires 40% or less of the vote only in the Parliamentary Party would allow Oli to split the party. Although less likely, Oli’s other possible ‘big action’ could be getting the president to dissolve the parliament and conducting a mid-term election.[19] Despite its unconstitutionality, Nepali Congress would not oppose the election simply because participating in an election with a split NCP would benef it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Next?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, nothing! No NCP leader wants the party to split. Although Oli has a minority in the party’s Secretariat, Central Committee, and Parliamentary Party when Nepal and Dahal are together, the prime minister enjoys executive control and, therefore, has state mechanisms in his favor. This means no matter how dissatisfied Dahal and Nepal are with Oli, they cannot make him resign easily through the majority or a party directive. To remove Oli, therefore, NCP would have to strip his party membership, file an official motion of no-confidence, and vote him out with a majority in the parliamentary party. However, the Nepal-Dahal faction is very cautious about taking any drastic action against Oli because if the PM introduces an ordinance and splits the party, as the leader of the new parliamentary party, he will stay the prime minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither Dahal nor Nepal wants to see the party split. Dahal simply would have nowhere to go and little political future left if he were to split from NCP. He has lost all his prominent Maoist friends and has no organizational base to revive his party. That is the reason he had to forego his “21st Century’s Peoples Democracy and Maoist ideology” and merge with Oli’s party with “People’s Multiparty Democracy” (Janata ko Bahudaliya Janabad or JaBaJa) ideology.[20] Although the NCP’s resulting ideology was the so-called “People’s Democracy” (Janata ko Janabad), the dominance of Oli’s JaBaJa has been clearly visible throughout. In fact, Oli has now started preparing his Province 1 cadres for JaBaJa through virtual meetings,[21] which he claims will gain relevance again after the general convention. What this indicates is Dahal’s political demise; if Oli does bulldoze his way under the ideological armor of JaBaJa, Dahal will have no option left than to follow submissively. After all, he has the burden of a long armed-conflict and has to evade international trials by taking political refuge under some party. NCP happens to be his most convenient option, which he cannot afford to gamble away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madhav Kumar Nepal happens to be at an interesting spot within the NCP. Ideologically, he would lean towards JaBaJa. Plus, he has significant clout in the party, and an Oli-Nepal alliance could go a long way, decimating Dahal or other groups. However, Nepal has little trust in Oli, who has repeatedly betrayed him and has proven that he cannot be trusted with his words. As an opportunist himself, Dahal has also cornered Nepal and made agreements with Oli on multiple occasions. Despite that, Nepal leans towards Dahal more than Oli. Nevertheless, Nepal’s confidence in Dahal is not due to his ideological inclination but rather due to a shared necessity of keeping authoritarian Oli in check. Even that has not helped, and Oli continues to intimidate all. One thing is clear though, if Oli somehow wins Nepal’s trust, brings him under his fold in the name of JaBaJa, Dahal’s political career will hit a new low.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0;\">\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://nagariknews.nagariknetwork.com/politics/372741-1604244668.html\" target=\"_target\">[1] https://nagariknews.nagariknetwork.com/politics/372741-1604244668.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/ncp-unity-under-threat-says-bishnu-paudel\" target=\"_target\">[2] https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/ncp-unity-under-threat-says-bishnu-paudel/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/10/31/oli-extends-an-olive-branch-to-dahal-but-the-latter-remains-unconvinced\" target=\"_target\">[3] https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/10/31/oli-extends-an-olive-branch-to-dahal-but-the-latter-remains-unconvinced</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://nagariknews.nagariknetwork.com/politics/373791-1604386826.html\" target=\"_blank\">[4] https://nagariknews.nagariknetwork.com/politics/373791-1604386826.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/11/03/160439688211198976.html\" target=\"_blank\">[5] https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/11/03/160439688211198976.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/11/03/160441024886663937.html\" target=\"_blank\">[6] https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/11/03/160441024886663937.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/54252/2020-11-05\" target=\"_blank\">[7] https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/54252/2020-11-05</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.setopati.com/opinion/220654\" target=\"_blank\">[8] https://www.setopati.com/opinion/220654</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/marriage-of-convenience/\" target=\"_blank\">[9] https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/marriage-of-convenience/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://nagariknews.nagariknetwork.com/politics/372741-1604244668.html\" target=\"_blank\">[10] https://nagariknews.nagariknetwork.com/politics/372741-1604244668.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/54252/2020-11-05\" target=\"_blank\">[11] https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/54252/2020-11-05</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/10/01/chief-secretary-lok-darshan-regmi-resigns\" target=\"_blank\">[12] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/10/01/chief-secretary-lok-darshan-regmi-resigns</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/53018/2020-10-14\" target=\"_blank\">[13] https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/53018/2020-10-14</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://en.setopati.com/political/154214\" target=\"_blank\">[14] https://en.setopati.com/political/154214</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/no-confidence-motion-against-karnali-cm-to-fail-as-madhav-nepal-faction-withdraws.html\" target=\"_blank\">[15] https://english.onlinekhabar.com/no-confidence-motion-against-karnali-cm-to-fail-as-madhav-nepal-faction-withdraws.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/11/02/what-does-oli-mean-by-big-action\" target=\"_blank\">[16] https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/11/02/what-does-oli-mean-by-big-action</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/54252/2020-11-05\" target=\"_blank\">[17] https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/54252/2020-11-05</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/3-new-ministers-in-oli-cabinet-dpm-pokharel-loses-defence-portfolio.html\" target=\"_blank\">[18] https://english.onlinekhabar.com/3-new-ministers-in-oli-cabinet-dpm-pokharel-loses-defence-portfolio.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.setopati.com/opinion/220654\" target=\"_blank\">[19] https://www.setopati.com/opinion/220654</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://gorkhapatraonline.com/opinion/2020-02-18-8857\" target=\"_blank\">[20] https://gorkhapatraonline.com/opinion/2020-02-18-8857</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/11/03/160439688211198976.html\" target=\"_blank\">[21] https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/11/03/160439688211198976.html</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Mahesh Kumar Kushwaha', '/uploads/banner_image/1671353820_oli-dahal-100x56.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12-03', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 20:42:00', '2022-12-18 20:42:00');

We must not continue it and we must not return to it.” Pompeo said the “only way to truly change communist China is to act not on the basis of what Chinese leaders say, but how they behave.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPompeo stated that over decades, US engagement policy—introduced by President Nixon in 1972—has built up “massive imbalance,” which, coupled with “Chinese Communist Party’s designs for hegemony” has generated threats to US ideals and the free world. US engagement policy was intended to induce China to change, but Pompeo believes that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has used the opportunity to become stronger and more menacing. He highlighted the spread of the pandemic, repressions, and trade abuses as examples of the gap between expectations and reality regarding China. Pompeo blamed the Chinese Communist Party as “Frankenstein” driven by Marxist-Leninist ideology, which has subverted corporate entities all over the world and whose goal is “global hegemony of Chinese communism.” He claimed that General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPompeo outlined several strategic shifts in the US policy. The first is “to induce China to change in more creative and assertive ways.” Second is to change the American people and US partners’ perceptions about the Chinese Communist Party. Pompeo’s argument was that the CCP is a threat to US and to the free world. Chinese businesses and PLA are controlled by the CCP. Therefore, Chinese businesses and the PLA are a threat to US national security interests and the free world. Another strategy is to push for fairness and reciprocity. “I call on every leader of every nation to start by doing what America has done – to simply insist on reciprocity, to insist on transparency and accountability from the Chinese Communist Party,” he said. The fourth is a possible alliance. “Maybe it’s time for a new grouping of like-minded nations, a new alliance of democracies,” he said. The fifth was a change in the defence strategy. According to Pompeo, US emphasis on cyber and space capabilities constitutes a dramatic shift in focus regarding strategic defense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.2 India<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndian PM Modi’s independence day speech<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring his independence day speech,[10] PM Modi of India highlighted several ideas that have a direct bearing on foreign policy and international relations. First, although he reasserted the notions of “whole world is one family” and global inter-dependence, Modi insisted that these ideas should be founded on self-reliance. He expressed the desire to become a hub of global supply chain. Second, he emphasized cooperation and partnership in South Asia and India’s “extended neighbourhood.” Third, PM Modi emphasized the need for national security and consolidation of India’s defense capabilities; a part of the strategy was integration of India’s border regions like Ladakh and Andaman and Nicobar islands. All these three ideas have significant implications for India’s relations with Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShift in India’s foreign policy?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvents in recent months have raised the question of whether India is going to shift foreign policy. Refusing to be pigeonholded as an US ally, India has so far adopted a non-aligned policy with the Indian PM Modi touting the Sanskrit slogan: all the world is a family—Basudaiva Kutumbakam. In recent months, however, India has felt that its sensitivity to China has not been reciprocated and there are signs that it may take a harder stance or finally choose a side: the Quad?[11] Similarly, border clash with China has resulted in nationalistic jingoism and prompted big Indian companies to seek alternative supply chains. Weaning away from China, however, is difficult for businesses and holds much uncertainty.[12] In the face of continued border differences, India has stood up to China and made its position clear. For example, speaking at a US-India Strategic Partership Forum, India’s External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar said that “India will match or respond to China’s capabilities in the same measure if Beijing continues to assert herself and influence areas or geographies.”[13]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile China continues military build-up,[14] India’s defense establishment continues to adopt an aggressive stance, with its Chief of Defense Staff insisting that India’s military options are open if talks do not yield results.[15] Confrontation between China and India escalated when Indian army trying to assert control over the southern banks of Lake Pangong.[16] India is also investing on potential military alliances. India’s participation in G7, has inflamed China as US has sought to deny China’s participation in the grouping. Similarly, Australia backed India in border tensions with China, further riling China.[17] In March, India collaborated on a Quad plus dialogue over the coronavirus pandemic, which included other countries like New Zealand, Vietnam and South Korea. The Times of India said “the effort is also an attempt to keep the Quad Plus countries within a certain sphere of influence and strategic direction.”[18] What started as a partnership for disaster relief in 2004 has turned out to be an alliance to limit China’s assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific. However, given New Zealand’s economic ties with China and Vietnam’s defence policy,[19] the two countries might want to avoid being trapped in great power rivalry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Victor Gao and Prem Shankar Jha, after coming to power, Prime Minister Modi took a series of steps to bolster strategies ties with the US and contain China, threatening security of China’s global trade and supply routes.[20] India appears to be opting for economic ties with China and strategic ties with US, but the main question is how it can balance these two interests. Chinese experts have questioned the sustainability and benefits of India’s attempts to decouple,[21] including moves like banning Chinese apps, holding Chinese goods from clearances[22] and boycotting Chinese goods.[23] While the social media has inflamed passions and made bilateral relations a hot topic of discussion,[24] the two countries have been unable to ease border tension.[25]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA.3 China<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina’s response<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChinese media have interpreted recent US efforts as a “new shock wave” and claim China has been able to withstand the “new cold war” in a “relatively stable manner.”[26] According to New York Times, after weeks of belligerent response, China has recently toned down its rhetoric so as not to allow Trump administration an excuse to use China for elections.[27] However, discussions in the Chinese media raise several questions including the sustainability of the US shock wave, the ability of the US to influence global affairs in the face of domestic troubles, the ability of China to withstand US pressure, and the possible division of public opinion within China. China is reasserting support to the Communist Party of China as it tries to deflect US attack on the CPC, gauge and strengthen public opinion against US measures,[28] enhance military preparedness,[29] strengthen global partnerships, and conduct surveillance of US military activities, particularly in South China Sea.[30]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn recent days, there’s been a growing focus on Biden’s policy. Chinese experts believe that if Biden wins, the US may move from a zero-sum game that perceives China as a strategic competitor to a policy that may be tough on human rights and economic interests, but at the same time prioritizes global cooperation on issues of mutual interest.[31]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina’s relations with Iran and Russia<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina’s is cultivating ties with Iran, to the extent that the two countries are about to enter into a long term military and economic partnership. However, the partnership is uneasy given conflicting ideology within Iran, “political fissures” in the Middle East, and efforts by US to counter a potential threat.[32] China has also sought to forge continued understanding with Russia on core interests of two countries including sovereignty, security and opposition to external interventions.[33] However, according to an opinion piece published in South China Morning Post, Maria Siow claimed that cracks have appeared in China-Russia relationship with India and US playing a role.[34]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina has also been expediting its push for a digital currency backed by its central bank as Chinese institutions are being sidelined from the SWIFT payment system and there are growing worries that it may also be sidelined from the global digital currency race. According to Global Times, “the cryptocurrency is a way for Beijing to challenge US dollar hegemony.”[35]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina’s response to India<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBorder differences between India and China persisted into late August, as the two countries conducted “provocative military movements” on the southern bank of Pangong Lake in the Ladakh region. China claimed[36] that Indian troops had broken promises and illegally intruded the Line of Actual Control. Global Times emphasized that “China must resolutely counterattack India’s opportunist move…China is several times stronger than India, and India is no match for China. We must smash any Indian illusion that it can deal with China by colluding with other powers, such as the US,” the editorial said.[37]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter skirmishes in the Galwan Valley, China has been raising the Kashmir issue in international fora, including the UN Security Council.[38][39] China urged India not to review Confucius Institutes that were being run in seven Indian colleges and 54 schools.[40] As China raises the stakes, India appears to be vulnerable on at least four fronts: its ability to manage COVID 19 and its economic impacts, Kashmir issue, and trade relations with China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the developments in international relations, China is likely to pursue an even more aggressive policy towards Nepal. China will be encouraged to develop closer ties with political parties in Nepal and invest in political stability (ie, ensure unity among and longevity of its political allies).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe conflict of interests of the international actors, is likely to exacerbate contradiction between Nepal’s national interests and partisan/individual interests. Nepal’s international relations is likely to become less and less transparent and coherent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTibet policy<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChinese President Xi Jinping’s policy for Tibet, stated during a high-level symposium on Tibet Work on August 29, will have significant ramifications for Nepal. China’s policy on Tibet focuses on national security, political stability, quality of life, environment, and border defense and “frontier” security, with emphasis on “foreign an ironclad shield to safeguard stability.” Xi stressed on incorporation of cultural education that emphasizes patriotism (Chinese nationalism) and loyalty to socialism with Chinese characteristics. According to Xi, “Tibetan Buddhism should be guided in adapting to the socialist society and should be developed in the Chinese context.” Chinese government and CPC will also support the party cadre’s “income, housing, medical care and retirement, as well as education for their children.”[41]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB. Nepal<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB.1 Nepal’s Relations with China<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina has been encouraging Nepal, successfully, to move away from Indian and western influence in both domestic affairs and international relations by taking “independent” decisions. This includes cooperating with China on COVID-19. China is currently providing development assistance to Nepal for about a dozen projects including transport and health infrastructure, tunnels and railways, and concessional loans. In addition to the delays caused by COVID-19, both sides acknowledged that there were issues related to planning and coordination.[42]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal took several steps to appease Chinese interests. In June, Cuba delivered a statement in the UN HRC on behalf of 53 countries including Nepal supporting China’s national security law for Hong Kong, asserting that Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China and asking “relevant sides to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs by using Hong Kong related issues.”[43] In July, MoFA said Nepal is in favour of concluding treaties and agreements with neighboring and other friendly countries on mutual legal assistance and extradition.[44] Indian media widely discussed a Chinese-funded study about why Nepali mercenaries join the Indian Army and interpret it as an attempt to weaken Nepal’s ties with India.[45]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina is competing globally to win trust by providing public goods in the fight against COVID 19 and contrasting US motives as self-serving.[46] Nepal is allowing clinical trials of a Chinese vaccine among Chinese workers at Hongshi Cement.[47] Earlier, Nepal participated in the sub-regional video conference of foreign ministers of China, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nepal. According to Chinese Foreign Ministry, the video conference reached consensus on five points: adhering to multilateralism and rejecting politicization of the epidemic, enhancing joint containment mechanisms, ensuring continuity of economic partnerships, promoting BRI (including Trans-HImalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network), and supporting the international system with the UN as the core.[48] Global Times published an article analysing India’s response to the four-country dialogue on COVID 19, saying the fight against COVID-19 is “more important that illusory geopolitical game in South Asia.”[49] Many experts in India interpreted this coalition as an attempt to isolate India.[50]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s political relations with China is growing despite some setbacks. Political office holders, including President Bidya Bhandari and Chinese President Xi Jinping, exchange congratulatory messages on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of official Nepal-China diplomatic ties. They messages emphasized strategic partnership of cooperation, connectivity, infrastructure and regional stability.[51] Shen Shiwei, CGTN new producer tweets pictures of Chinese infrastructure groundwork close to Nepal border including the Gyirong railway—which will be completed in two years[52]—and a transmission line.[53]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere were however, some negative reactions to Chinese influence in Nepal. The first was the perception that Chinese were involved in micromanaging domestic politics. The second was that after years of defending its move to buy Chinese aircraft—and suffering heavy losses and debt—the NAC finally grounded Chinese aircraft.[54]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB.2 Dialogue with India<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPM Oli is trying to revive political dialogue with India; his close aides have been eager to publicize early breakthroughs. On the occasion of India’s Independence Day, PM Oli talked to Prime Minister of India for the first time in over four months.[55] The telephonic conversation focused on COVID 19 cooperation well as India’s election to the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member. Experts close to PM Oli tried to portray the dialogue as an end to a deadlock and had opened the possibility of future talks.[56] BBC Nepali analysis claims that although the initiation of dialogue was a positive step, it shouldn’t be taken as an end of India’s “diplomatic silence” or end of absence of dialogue between Nepal and India.[57]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCiting foreign affairs experts and ministry officials, Kantipur claims that Nepal and India are yet to enter on main issues.[58] During the meeting of the oversight mechanism, Nepali officials failed to raise their concerns related to lack of progress on issues related to the border, EPG, and reconstruction. The issue of Ramayana circuit was just for the sake of formality, it quoted a foreign ministry official as saying. The Kathmandu Post reported that the meeting of the Boundary Working Group will be held soon.[59]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal-India Oversight Mechanism (set up in 2016) reviews the status of projects being implemented under bilateral cooperation and tries to address concerns about project delays.[60] The projects include roads in the Terai, cross-border railways, Arun III hydropower project, oil pipeline, Pancheswore, post-earthquake reconstruction, integrated check posts, Ramayana circuit and many others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere has been a breakdown in meaningful political dialogue between Nepal and India since the end of 2019. Talking to CESIF, Nepal’s Foreign Minister, Pradeep Gyawali said Nepal waited for India’s response to the border issue until November 2019 and proceeded to amend the constitution only when the Indian side was not forthcoming. He, however, claimed that Nepal’s dialogue with India has continued across multiple formal mechanisms. In an interview with Kantipur Television on July 20, he said Nepal was trying to “reset geo-political relations” and added that flippant remarks from many sides were harming such efforts.[61]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB.4 PM Oli’s role in geopolitics<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPM Oli’s actions, some of them unnecessary and openly antagonistic, have been responsible for eroding trust between Nepal and India. BBC News Nepali versions outlines several moves by PM Oli that served to annoy India: Nepal’s new map, statements in the parliament on Indian virus and India’s attitude, the claim that India is trying to remove him from office, and statement on Ram Janmabhoomi, and provisions on citizenship among others.[62]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoFA was forced to clarify PM Oli’s claims regarding Shri Rama. PM Oli a day before had claimed that Rama was born in Thori of Nepal.[63] Oli’s remarks regarding Shri Rama and Ayodha drew heavy criticism in both Nepal and India[64] and, together with political differences over the border, raised the possibility of damaging bilateral relations at the social level.[65]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and India have also sparred over Gautam Buddha’s identity. MoFA commented on GoN’s comment on Indian External Affairs Minister’s claim regarding Gautam Buddha’s Indian identity.[66] The Ministry of External Affairs of India responded by saying, “EAM’s remarks yesterday at the CII event referred to our shared Buddhist heritage. There is no doubt that Gautam Buddha was born in Lumbini, which is in Nepal.”[67]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB.4 Ruling party and geopolitics<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInternational geo-political dynamics is generating strains in the ruling party. India, China and the US figure heavily in Nepal Communist Party’s internal differences.[68] The debate over parliamentary approval of the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact divided the party into two blocs and affected the election of a new Speaker of the House. The issue of the Speaker was finally resolved when the party decided not to approve the MCC Compact at the time. Similarly, during a public function on 28 June, PM Oli claimed that India was intent on removing him from office.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChinese Ambassador Hou Yanqui met former PM Madhav Kumar Nepal generating questions about the Chinese Ambassador’s role in mediating NCP’s internal differences.[69]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB.5 MCC<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe MCC Compact and relations with India continue to figure heavily in the differences between PM KP Oli and the faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda. The task force formed to resolve internal differences says the MCC Compact should not be approved without amendments and differences with India regarding the border should be resolved through diplomacy.[70]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUS ambassador to Nepal Randy Berry met Deputy PM and Defense Minister Ishwar Pokhrel and expresses concern about MCC Compact. Although Nepal had included MCC Compact funds in the policies and programs of this fiscal year, it was later removed due to objections from the Nepal Communist Party. Nepal has now requested deferral of the implementation date citing COVID 19 and not political differences. The government is in favour of the MCC but there is opposition from within the ruling party.[71]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe MCC Compact is also debated heavily within the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP). The two likely options were whether to keep silent on the issue or demand amendment prior to ratification. Many individuals in the party frame the MCC as a “counter” to China’s BRI but support ratification with amendments.[72]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB.6 Nepal Army<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal Army’s role in Nepal-India relations has grown in significance. Nepal Army established a separate directorate for border monitoring and management[73] after cabinet approval. The government has introduced a policy making it mandatory to include Nepal Army on all mechanisms related to border management and security. The directorate will also be in charge of archiving sensitive and important documents related to the border.[74] The Indian embassy handed over 10 ventilators, a gift of the Indian Army, to the Nepal Army, which has been a key instrument in tackling COVID 19 pandemic in Nepal.[75]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC. Analysis and Conclusion<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUS and Nepal<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUS Secretary of State Pompeo’s statements indicates the possibility of an aggressive US campaign against China, which in turn will put a lot of pressure on US allies (eg, UK, India, Australia, Japan) and strategically positioned countries around the world like Nepal. If elected, Joe Biden may adopt a different strategy. The US presidential election, therefore, may have significant implications for Nepal’s future geo-political relations. Whatever the scenario, trade and technological decoupling looks increasingly likely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal is likely to face increased pressure from India and the US regarding its relationship and cooperation with China. This could mean that Nepal’s technological and financial integration with the global economy may become fragmented and incompatible. A strident policy against China will make it difficult for US to conduct development cooperation in Nepal (eg, MCC) as their motives will be questioned. Nepal will remain unwilling to do anything that may be perceived to be against China’s interests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina and Nepal<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina has diversified its economy so that it is no longer dependent on supply chains for economic growth. China has diplomatic and economic clout globally, as indicated by Cuba’s statement in the UN on behalf of 53 countries regarding security law in Hong Kong. As international pressure against China grows, Nepal’s value for China will increase. Nepal, currently is of critical importance for China as a neighbour, as a region bordering Tibet, as a buffer with India, and as a partner in the international fora. China is therefore likely to continue to invest on strategic partnerships, connectivity and regional geo-political stability, which means Nepal will remain critical for China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf Cuba’s statement on Hong Kong is taken as an indicator, China currently has about 53 hardcore allies in the UN system, including Nepal. Given the current political regimes inability to displease China and eagerness to displease US and India, Nepal is seen from outside as having moved closer to China. Given the conflict between US/India and China, the process of political, financial, and technological shift towards China become irreversible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt present, China’s interest in Nepal has aided the ruling political regime take stand against India, and capture the public’s imagination by talking about big infrastructure projects and development cooperation with China. Given China’s rise and its critical interest, Nepal will need to be more efficient and capable in managing geo-political rivalry. Nepal also needs to ensure that Chinese interests do not harm Nepal’s economy, distort domestic politics, or promote corruption. This requires a broader national consensus on Nepal’s national interests as well as transparency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia and Nepal<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndia’s relationship with China also indicates that rapprochement between India and China is not easy, and will take a lot of effort and time. It is easier for India to move away from China rather than toward China. Modi’s Independence Day speech indicates that India is willing to replace China as the hub of global supply chain, but this task would be much more difficult for India than it was for China. As reflected in the Independence Day speech of PM Modi, India’s stated policy aspirations around national identity, economic development and national security have significant implications for relations with Nepal. Many obstacles have emerged in India’s attempts to maintain cordial relations with China, and improving relationship with China will be a difficult task that partly depends on future US policies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s relations with India, in recent years, has been defined by Nepal’s desire to move away from India’s influence (or the shadow of special relationships) and take “independent” decisions. This move has been compounded by China’s growing interest and engagements in Nepal, PM Oli’s use of Nepali nationalism and promotion of anti-Indian rhetoric, issues with India’s development assistance in Nepal, and substantial differences related to the border and its management.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s relations with India is not likely to improve soon, given the role of China, nationalist sentiments, partisan political interests, corruption, and bottlenecks in managing the border and development cooperation. However, this should not prevent Nepal from ensuring continuity of existing cross-border relationships, enhancing connectivity, and developing trusted relationship with India and China, which will also help relationship between India and China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s foreign policy<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEfforts are underway to reset and rebalance Nepal’s foreign policy, which has lost coherence in recent years. The Kathmandu Post reported that Nepal drafting a new foreign policy document.[76] Similarly, Nepal government is working on a new code of conduct that seeks to streamline relations between Nepali actors and foreign interests.[77] Experts involved in the new foreign policy frequently cite shift in global power relations, which means acknowledging China’s growing influence. At the same time, however, Nepal’s relations with India and the west have come under strain. Former Minister Kamal Thapa’s tweet highlighted this tension, “PM Oli says the Indian ambassador is active in pulling down the government. On the other side, the Chinese Ambassador goes to homes of leaders to protect the government. Will a democratic republic run by such remote control serve Nepal’s interests?”[78]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal needs to develop a diplomatic strategy to protect its national interests and manage relationships during heightened conflict between US/India and China. This may require a greater understanding with Germany and the European Union, in addition to China and the Quad.[79]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s desire to move away from Indian influence resonates with public sentiments. India and the West must be prepared to respect Nepal’s nationalist sentiments and allow Nepalis to exercise autonomy and forge a new understanding based on equality. On the other, hand, Nepal must be able to carve a path by creating an understanding with China, India and the US. In this sense, Nepal’s foreign and defense policy predicaments are similar to that of Vietnam,[80] and needs to protect Nepal’s national interests vis-a-vis that of China, US[81] and India.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal should issue a new foreign policy white paper that resonates closely with Nepal’s national defense policy. Both these documents should be used as a means to make Nepal’s national interests, perspective and priorities clear to the international community and to the Nepali people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnnex I<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal and Geo-politics<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTime line of Key Events (July-August 2020)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAugust 27<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMinistry of Finance and China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) hold a video conference. According to a press statement issued by the Ministry, “consensus (was) reached to expedite the implementation and construction of China-funded development projects.” The Chinese side promised to provide more support for COVID 19, and work to complete and scale up projects after effects of the pandemic ease down. The two sides acknowledged the need to resolve issues related to planning and coordination. The key projects currently under planning and implementation are: improvement of Araniko Highway and the Ring Road, extension of Bir Hospital, coordinated border management at Korala Customs Point, Madan Bhandari Science and Technology University Project, Livelihood Improvement Projects in northern districts of Nepal, feasibility study of Tokha-Chhare and Betrabati-Syafrubesi tunnels, China-Nepal Cross-Border Railway and Exim Bank concessional loans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAugust 25<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTKP reports that Nepal drafting a new foreign policy document and trying to restart political dialogue with India.[82]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal is allowing clinical trials of Remdesivir and three vaccines against COVID 19. The vaccines are from China, Russia and Oxford University. China has asked permission to conduct trial among Chinese workers at Hongshi Cement.[83] The trial of Remdesivir, meanwhile, was earlier planned to be conducted in cooperation with WHO, but is now being conducted directly with the producer.[84]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAugust 24<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter years of defending its move to buy Chinese aircraft—and suffering heavy losses and debt—the NAC finally grounds Chinese aircraft.[85]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAugust 23<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe MCC Compact and relations with India continue to figure heavily in the differences between PM KP Oli and the faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda.

The government is in favour of the MCC but there is opposition from within the ruling party.[103]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJuly 21<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShen Shiwei, CGTN new producer tweets pictures of Chinese infrastructure groundwork close to Nepal border including the Gyirong railway—which will be completed in two years[104]—and a transmission line.[105]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJuly 20<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cabinet gives permission to the Nepal Army to form a new directorate on border monitoring, management and security. The government has introduced a policy making it mandatory to include Nepal Army on all mechanisms related to border management and security. The directorate will also be in charge of archiving sensitive and important documents related to the border.[106]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere has been a breakdown in meaningful political dialogue between Nepal and India since the end of 2019. Talking to CESIF, Nepal’s Foreign Minister, Pradeep Gyawali said Nepal waited for India’s response to the border issue until November 2019 and proceeded to amend the constitution only when the Indian side was not forthcoming. He, however, claimed that Nepal’s dialogue with India has continued across multiple formal mechanisms. In an interview with Kantipur Television on July 20, he said Nepal was trying to “reset geo-political relations” and added that flippant remarks from many sides were harming such efforts.[107]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJuly 15<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBBC News Nepali versions outlines several moves by PM Oli that served to annoy India: Nepal’s new map, statements in the parliament on Indian virus and India’s attitude, the claim that India is trying to remove him from office, and statement on Ram Janmabhoomi, and provisions on citizenship among others.[108]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJuly 14, 2020<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoFA is forced to clarify PM Oli’s claims regarding Shri Rama. PM Oli a day before had claimed that Rama was born in Thori of Nepal.[109] Oli’s remarks regarding Shri Rama and Ayodha drew heavy criticism in both Nepal and India[110] and, together with political diffeences over the border, raised the possibility of damaging bilateral relations at the social level.[111]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJuly 13<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe MCC Compact is also debated heavily within the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP). The two likely options were whether to keep silent on the issue or demand amendment prior to ratification.

Safe environment for women and girls can fairly be considered a privilege. Despite having stringent laws against sexual violence in place, rape and other sexual violence is perennial. The statistics present a distressing story. The occurrence of rape is escalating over the years. In the fiscal year 2019/20, approximately 2,144 rape cases and 687 attempt-to-rape cases were registered[1], while many go unreported. In the past few months, the country has witnessed exponential surge in rape cases and mostly the victims are found to be minor girls. As per the data submitted by Nepal police, 60% of rape victims are aged below 15 years, particularly between 11 to 15 years.[2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a common perception of the society that women are unsafe outside their homes. They are often told to dress “modestly”, to stay in at night and take measures to prevent one from getting raped or sexually violated. Thus, with the nationwide lockdown, crimes against women were anticipated to diminish. While the rate of other crimes has fallen during the lockdown, rape has continued to shoot up.[3] This is because the perpetrators in the majority of the cases are victim’s relatives. Women and girls are not safe inside their own houses as well. It is found that rapes are usually done by the persons known to the victim. General statistics of rape suggests that 93% of rapists are people familiar to the victim and only 7% rapes are committed by unknown persons.[4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The youth activists have come out on protests against the rampant occurrence of sexual crimes demanding justice for the victims of rape. The activists were compelled to come on streets due to the uncontrollable incidents of rape. They demonstrated a flash mob in Maitighar Mandala raging against the incessantly rising rape cases all across the country.[5] Further, the alarming number of rape cases on everyday basis has raised serious concerns and even prompted deliberations on capital punishment to the perpetrators of such heinous crime.[6] The matter was taken up in the parliament as well, where many parliamentarians unanimously expressed that perpetrators of rape should be given severe punishment which may include death penalty. Women lawmakers are of the view that an individual committing such heinous crime do not deserve sympathy.[7] Moreover, the women parliamentarians have formed a committee to review current laws with respect to rape along with international commitments to recommend encompassing capital punishment for the crime of rape.[8]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The laws with respect to rape are fairly stringent in the country. However, the problem lies with the implementation of these laws and politicising of the rape cases. The incompetency of police to carry out a proper investigation is a huge hurdle in the rape cases. Victims in most rape cases fail to receive justice due to lack of evidence. Considering the rate of acquittal in the rape cases, it is still difficult for the victims to get justice even if the laws are changed. The systemic violence in Nepal’s criminal justice system shackles even the most effective laws and it remains largely underutilised. Likewise, former chief Justice Sushila Karki also opines that it is not the insufficiency of laws but the enforcement that requires being more effective.[9] She further states death penalty is not the solution as it has not prevented rape in countries India and Bangladesh.[10]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal is party to and has ratified major international human rights conventions. Though these conventions do not expressly prohibit capital punishment, the Constitution of Nepal does. Article 16 (2), right to life with dignity states that no law shall be made to prescribe the death penalty. This is a commendable step and is particularly important for rape cases as well. Currently, there is a public outcry for punishing rapists with the most severe of punishments with many even voicing their desire to see rapists hung and sentenced to death. However, the death penalty is not a viable option for rape cases due to various reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capital punishment does not necessarily act as a deterrent as there has been no conclusive proof towards this point. The threat of capital punishment can also cause rape offenders to commit crimes of murder and mutilation in an effort to ensure that the victim is unable to identify them or file a complaint. Rather than serving as a deterrent, capital punishment could lead to more heinous crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protest for capital punishment is driven more by public outrage rather than serious consideration of the solutions to bring about a change. Most governments that adopt this punishment do so to advance their own public image rather than considering the judicial implications of their decisions. The judiciary is another aspect to consider when thinking of implementing capital punishments. Most judicial actors would not have consensus on what type of punishments would qualify for capital punishment and whether the accused are even guilty. In the current state of the Nepali judiciary, equipping the judiciary with the power to impose the death penalty could cause more harm than good. Furthermore, a retributive justice system is not a sustainable justice system. The judiciary would be faced with increased pressure to award capital punishment on a few cases that spark public outcry as opposed to handing out an even sentence in every case. This is a slippery slope as with every passing case, the judiciary will render itself hostage to public opinion rather than carrying out its job to dispense justice without any undue influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Undue influence also poses another problem with regard to victims of rape. In majority of the rape cases, the perpetrator is usually a person known to the victim such as a family member. The threat of the death penalty may cause hesitation for the victim to report the case against their own family member and a victim may face further pressure from their family members to suppress the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, rape must not be equated with death. The patriarchal notion that a woman’s life is destroyed upon rape needs to be challenged. It is this patriarchal society that forces the belief that a woman’s life is destroyed when she is sexually assaulted and she has no place in society anymore. Feminists have come out strongly against this notion and believe that “rape is a tool of patriarchy, an act of violence, and has nothing to do with morality, character or behaviour”.[11]</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0;\">\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.nepalisansar.com/government/nepal-sees-rise-in-sexual-assault-and-rape-cases/%23:~:text=Around%202%2C144%20rape%20cases%20and,the%20fiscal%20year%202019%2F20.&amp;text=According%20to%20the%20Nepal%20Police\'s,the%20fiscal%20year%202019%2F20\" target=\"_blank\">[1] https://www.nepalisansar.com/government/nepal-sees-rise-in-sexual-assault-and-rape-cases/#:~:text=Around%202%2C144%20rape%20cases%20and,the%20fiscal%20year%202019%2F20.&amp;text=According%20to%20the%20Nepal%20Police’s,the%20fiscal%20year%202019%2F20</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/rape-cases-in-nepal-peaked-in-past-two-months/\" target=\"_blank\">[2] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/rape-cases-in-nepal-peaked-in-past-two-months/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[3] Ibid.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.idiva.com/news-opinion/womens-issues/women-are-not-safe-inside-homes-rapists-known-to-victims/18004578\" target=\"_blank\">[4] https://www.idiva.com/news-opinion/womens-issues/women-are-not-safe-inside-homes-rapists-known-to-victims/18004578</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/multimedia/photo-gallery/photo-gallery-youth-activists-stage-symbolic-protest-against-rising-rape-cases-in-the-country/?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR1WFiu0Sj0r3meC0WwxX2w8ds9qLXig7YfRSjakI7VbY7iCE8U6HzoYEjw%23Echobox=1602348640\" target=\"_blank\">[5] https://thehimalayantimes.com/multimedia/photo-gallery/photo-gallery-youth-activists-stage-symbolic-protest-against-rising-rape-cases-in-the-country/?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR1WFiu0Sj0r3meC0WwxX2w8ds9qLXig7YfRSjakI7VbY7iCE8U6HzoYEjw#Echobox=1602348640.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/nepal-women-protest-surge-in-rape-cases/a-55248955\" target=\"_blank\">[6] https://www.dw.com/en/nepal-women-protest-surge-in-rape-cases/a-55248955</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[7] Ibid.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[8] Ibid.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/how-appropriate-is-demand-for-death-penalty-to-rapists/?fbclid=IwAR2SMpQv_s6ZU6dC7fPAemHW6UlGeJ0Wv07STLDj-iVL7ZKPhikPnIQvC_E\" target=\"_blank\">[9] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/how-appropriate-is-demand-for-death-penalty-to-rapists/?fbclid=IwAR2SMpQv_s6ZU6dC7fPAemHW6UlGeJ0Wv07STLDj-iVL7ZKPhikPnIQvC_E</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[10] Ibid.</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://thewire.in/women/rape-death-penalty\" target=\"_blank\">[11] https://thewire.in/women/rape-death-penalty</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Lumana Upreti', '/uploads/banner_image/1671354156_sling-1222466_1280-100x73.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12-03', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 20:47:36', '2022-12-18 20:47:36'),

As', NULL, '<p>September Analysis<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe chilling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not inconspicuous anymore. The world has severely suffered in terms of health which led to a deteriorating world economy. As of September 24, 2020, there are approximately 32 million cases, 22 million have recovered while the death toll stands at around 978,000 deaths. From the economic perspective, the worst-case scenario assumes that the world will lose USD 35.3 trillion by 2025 if a vaccine isn’t developed by then.[1] Contrastingly, in the best-case scenario, assuming the countries experience a single wave in 2020 and a mild outbreak in 2021, the global loss will be USD 17.6 trillion till 2025. The failure of the government’s worldwide to introduce stimulus relief packages and explore viable methods to sustain the economy and save lives simultaneously has drastically impacted the global growth. Months long lockdown has done more damage than good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, the Nepal economy has severely contracted through the various phases of lockdown and prohibitory orders from March-September; approximately six-month lengthy lockdown. Merely 4% of the industries were fully operational, 35% partially, and 61% were completely shut. Due to negligible revenue and productivity, 22.4% labourers were reportedly laid-off whereas many labourers faced heavy salary-cuts.[2] Several Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises have also filed for bankruptcy. A survey revealed that over 50% of the MSMEs face the risk of permanently shutting down.[3] A chain of reaction has been explained through the cycle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis reaction is dreadful for enterprises who lose revenue, demand, and are exposed to the risk of defaulting loans or other credits. MSMEs are incredibly crucial for Nepal’s economy; however, with a decline in demand and revenue, employers had no option but to forego employees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to ILO, lower-middle-income countries like Nepal witnessed the most massive plunge in labour income losses reaching 15.1%.[4] One of the prime reasons for this is because, in developing countries like Nepal, the workers in informal and blue-collar jobs are the ones who are the most affected. Furthermore, the lack of production activity across the country also attributes to the labour loss income.[5] Global data reveals that higher the fiscal stimulus as a percentage of GDP, lower the loss in labour working hours. However, this recovery through fiscal stimulus has been more prominent in high-income countries (such as Germany) and may prove unsuccessful in Nepal due to the limited spending capability. ILO further said that lower-middle-income countries need to inject USD 937 billion more to reach the same level of fiscal stimulus as high-income countries. Experts suggested that the countries must at least redirect their finances from other objectives to mitigate the labour crisis.[6]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Nepal’s macroeconomic update, the agricultural sector will grow as paddy yield may increase after the monsoon; however, this depends on the timely procurement and use of fertilizers. The update also highlighted that the overall output across the country would decrease and there will be a contraction in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Similarly, service sector undoubtedly has faced the most massive slump as tourism, both domestic and international, remains closed. As Nepal’s most celebrated festivals are approaching, Dashain and Tihar, businesses have still not shown progress in revenue and operation since the people/ locals are scared about stepping out to shop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada had announced an ambitious growth rate of 7% during the budget speech against Asian Development Bank’s recent growth prediction at a mere 1.5% for the current fiscal year. According to Central Bureau of Statistics, in the third quarter of the previous fiscal year, Nepal’s growth rate was 0.8%[7] which is concerning as the fourth quarter result (during the initial lockdown months) will be even more devastating. This raises concerns for a negative growth rate which might be hinting towards a probable recession. Furthermore, a sharp plunge in India’s economy, Nepal’s primary trade partner, will also have a cascading effect on Nepal’s economic situation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAgain, the macroeconomic update, assuming a good harvest, modest oil prices, and subdued non-food prices on weak domestic demand, projected that the inflation rate would average at 5.5%, which is 0.7% points down from the previous year. Moreover, the current fiscal account deficit will widen to -1.9% as remittances have plunged.[8]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s economic situation will worsen if, by 2021, the advanced economies do not bounce back for employment purposes. This will take a long-term hit at Nepal’s remittances and labour income. The policy focus should entirely be on saving the health and economy of Nepal. Other objectives are trivial in terms of the COVID-19 recovery. Nonetheless, the financial stability of Nepal is still at risk due to the uncertainty around COVID-19 and a robust recovery plan for Nepal. The government needs to be more transparent with its programs, policies and spending. It must also inject money into the economy to drive fiscal stimulus and counter the economic plunge triggered by a fall-in-demand. Untimely action by the policymakers will cost Nepal it’s growth and progress up till now.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shraddha More', '/uploads/banner_image/1671354191_finance-4599824_1280-100x69.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12', '2020-12-02', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 20:48:11', '2022-12-18 20:48:11'),

Millions of', NULL, '<p>September Analysis<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarting March 24, 2020, The Nepali government imposed a nationwide lockdown amidst the rising number of cases in the country. Millions of people were barred from leaving their homes with restrictions on trips to stores other than pharmacies, and transportation halted with the exception of essential goods. Such extreme measures were unprecedented but considered necessary to “flatten the curve” with countries all over the world going into lockdown. [1]The Hubei Province in China, including Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the outbreak began, is a lockdown success story. The province went into a lockdown on January 23. According to China’s National Health Commission, cases began to decline and by 19 March and no new infections had been detected. [2]However, the WHO has said that “Lockdown alone won’t be enough, how many more is decided on the basis of decision we make and action we take”. As cases continue to peak despite strict prohibitory measures, Nepal is also facing other major hurdles in its fight against Covid-19.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCountries have achieved a great deal of success in curbing the spread of the virus by enforcing a lockdown. However, they have also used the time to ramp up their testing and contact tracing efforts that are key in slowing the spread and not overwhelming the health system until a vaccine is found. However, lockdown appears to have failed as a strategy in Nepal. [3]Although Nepal is not a rich country like the US, with a ventilator bank or an established epidemic response office, this is precisely why a lockdown seemed ideal, to buy the government time to ramp up efforts in areas they were lacking. Nonetheless, even after over 4 months of a blanket lockdown, cases have continued to rise at alarming rates, leaving people wondering if the hardships endured during this period were worthwhile.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperts have long maintained that a lockdown cannot beat the virus on its own. Healthcare workers in Nepal have said that along with the hardships of a weak health system, Nepal is faced with other hurdles. For instance, due to the low testing capacity, the spread of the virus has not slowed down and has reached the community level in various places, when early tests and detection are the keys to successful stemming of the spread. If testing efforts are not ramped up, infections will go untested and number of cases will continue to multiply. [4]Furthermore, the stigma associated to Covid-19 has made contact tracing difficult. According to health workers, cases of self-misidentification and purposely ignoring phone calls from health officers so that individuals can keep their medical condition hidden are common. Due to the stigma attached to the virus, the infected fear being alienated from the society if identified. [5]Similarly, while in other countries, health care workers are applauded as heroes, in Nepal they are facing social stigmatization. As the virus has continued to spread, the stigma surrounding the virus has also been spreading. The government should tackle the issue through efforts to generate public awareness and dissemination of accurate information about the virus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInfections among healthcare workers that have been working on the frontline due of the lack of better protection has become another obstacle for Nepal. The country has been observing an alarming rise in infection rate among health workers and those in over 150 health facilities have tested positive for the virus. [6]According to the Ministry of Health and Population, while over 800 health workers across the country have tested positive, one health worker has died because of the virus. [7]Health workers in hospitals private, state-run, and community, have complained that they are forced to reuse disposable masks due to the shortage of masks in hospitals. They have also complained about having to reuse other protective gear and equipment. “The World Health Organization has said that health workers are at risk on two fronts; shortage of personal protective equipment and the chance of being infected in hospitals”. Nepal’s health system is already overwhelmed and under capacitated, if the infection among health workers is not controlled, we may face a shortage of health workers to treat patients.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lack of strategic planning has led to more severe consequences of the pandemic. [8]Over 500 people have lost their lives and at the current rate, Nepal is likely to overtake China, with its roughly 85,000 cases against a population of 1.4 billion, in about a week. As the government has failed to make progress in containing the spread, yet another lockdown seems imminent. However, if issues such as ramping up contact tracing efforts, protection of healthcare workers, and generating public awareness about Covid-19 to tackle stigmatization, are not addressed, they can become major obstacles in Nepal’s fight against Covid-19.</p>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671354368_vaccination-5502034_1280-100x83.png', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12', '2020-12-02', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 20:51:08', '2022-12-18 20:51:08'),

For Oli, the constitution is only a means to that end; in the past, he has expressed his willingness to amend the constitution merely to appease Bamdev Gautam and save his chair.[3] Despite its glorification, Nepal’s constitution has its weaknesses, for it has failed to address the challenges, dreams, aspirations, and grievances of certain groups and communities. Nevertheless, the supreme law of the land holds a sacred place in a democracy, which the country’s democratically elected ruler has the utmost responsibility to uphold. However, PM Oli’s recent remarks and actions show exactly the opposite—the PM cares little about the constitution and its provisions that he and his comrades so haughtily endorsed not too long ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most striking characteristics of Nepal’s constitution, federalism faces a direct assault from the incumbent prime minister. Earlier this month, PM Oli claimed that “provincial governments are administrative units of the federal government.”[4] For this anti-federalist remark, Oli received widespread criticism from within his party as well as from provincial leaders, federalism experts, and political analysts. However, this was not the first time PM Oli made such an anti-federalist remark. In May 2019, too, he had explicitly stated that the provincial and local governments are the administrative units of the federal government.[5] This flawed rhetoric and understanding of federalism seem to be guiding PM Oli and his government in the wrong direction. Recent political and administrative events and development evidence the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP)’s aggressive intervention in provincial matters in Lumbini and Karnali provinces shows the lack of respect for Nepal’s federalism. First, NCP chairs Oli and Dahal unilaterally named Province 5 as Lumbini and decided Rapti Valley—Deukhuri, Dang as its capital.[6] While the move caused heated demonstrations and vandalism from the opposition party workers, it also invited an intra-party dispute led by chief minister Shankar Pokharel and NCP leader Bishnu Poudel, who had different demands regarding the capital. Given a fragile balance within the party and a constant power struggle among the leaders, NCP’s internal dispute caused by the event is not surprising. However, the move undermines the spirit of Nepal’s federalism as ensured by the constitution. Naming a province and/or determining its capital is solely under the jurisdiction of the provincial government; unilateral top-down decision by top-leaders of the ruling federal government makes a mockery of the provincial autonomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vote of no-confidence against Karnali’s chief minister orchestrated by PM Oli and the events following it paint yet another picture of Nepal’s struggling federalism. Some provincial lawmakers, hailing particularly from the erstwhile NCP-Unified Marxist Leninist, filed a vote of no-confidence motion against CM Mahendra Bahadur Shahi, who comes from the former NCP-Maoist.[7] However, NCP’s top leadership heavily intervened in the matter, which should have been dealt with at the provincial level. NCP Chair Dahal successfully brought leader Madhav Kumar Nepal and provincial lawmakers close to Nepal his side,[8] therefore neutralizing the motion and cornering PM Oli instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The events related to Lumbini and Karnali mentioned above and the nature and degree of the ruling party’s involvement confirm PM Oli’s perception of federalism. He does seem to consider provincial bodies as administrative units to be controlled and overseen by the federal government. This mentality of his probably stems from his personal authoritative nature, which has caused him a series of problems within the party and in the government. Oli not only takes pride in his status as an ‘elected’ prime minister but derives pleasure from his display of authority. This has been evident throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; apparently, PM Oli does not listen to the experts[9] and instead makes most decisions unilaterally, some of which even the ministers are unaware of. Similarly, his working nature has been criticized by his party members for being unilateral. Despite multiple discussions and agreements, for instance, Oli went ahead and made political and diplomatic appointments unilaterally.[10] He also reshuffled the cabinet and appointed his confidantes as ministers almost unilaterally.[11] This authoritative nature of Oli and his unwillingness to listen to or consult party chief Dahal, let alone other party members, have caused constant friction within the party, which has once again reached to the verge of a split.[12]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, federalism has been proven to be an effective tool to manage diversity and discourage secessionist movements. In Nepal, too, the roots of federal aspirations lie in the country’s ethnic diversity, particularly concerning Madhes. In fact, Nepal even saw a growing secessionist movement in Madhes led by Dr. C.K. Raut. While Dr. Raut has made a truce with the government and his movement is no longer active, deep existing grievances and historical discrimination against certain groups and communities do not completely disqualify their aspiration for a separate state. Against this backdrop, therefore, federalism is the best way to address the concerns of these groups. Federalism allows a certain degree of legal, political, financial, and administrative autonomy to provincial and local bodies. Besides, federalism also works as a good decentralization model, which eventually helps in the country’s overall development. While the constitution ensures it, the ruling party and the prime minister are constantly working to undermine federalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An assault on federalism—either through direct anti-federalist remarks or actions undermining it— is one of the most serious breach of the constitution. The ongoing pandemic further exposed this phenomenon and PM Oli’s centralist mindset, reluctant to acknowledge the autonomy and power of provincial and local government. For instance, instead of collaborating with provincial and local governments, the Oli administration empowered Chief District Offices,[13] which operate as an extension of the federal government, and authorized them to make important decisions regarding lockdown and COVID-19 management. Contrary to what PM Oli claims, provincial and local bodies are not administrative units of the federal government, and they are not supposed to work under CDOs. Instead, the country’s executive chief should acknowledge the authority and autonomy these bodies are ensured by the constitution. A disregard for this important characteristic may invite an accident otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[1] A folk musical instrument of Nepal</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/02/24/15825088672642019.html\" target=\"_blank\">[2] https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/02/24/15825088672642019.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/ncp-working-to-amend-constitution-to-allow-gautam-to-become-pm/\" target=\"_blank\">[3] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/ncp-working-to-amend-constitution-to-allow-gautam-to-become-pm/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/53318/2020-10-19\" target=\"_blank\">[4] https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/53318/2020-10-19</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2019/05/21/oli-makes-yet-another-remark-that-contradicts-the-spirit-of-federalism\" target=\"_blank\">[5] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2019/05/21/oli-makes-yet-another-remark-that-contradicts-the-spirit-of-federalism</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/10/03/ruling-party-undermines-spirit-of-federalism-again-as-it-decides-name-for-province-5-and-its-capital\" target=\"_blank\">[6] https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/10/03/ruling-party-undermines-spirit-of-federalism-again-as-it-decides-name-for-province-5-and-its-capital</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/10/13/160260327940857633.html\" target=\"_blank\">[7] https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/10/13/160260327940857633.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/10/14/karnali-row-exposes-fault-lines-in-nepal-communist-party\" target=\"_blank\">[8] https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/10/14/karnali-row-exposes-fault-lines-in-nepal-communist-party</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/23/2020/10/06/officials-shut-their-ears-to-experts-on-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\">[9] https://kathmandupost.com/23/2020/10/06/officials-shut-their-ears-to-experts-on-covid-19</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/oli-govt-s-appointments-are-a-mockery-of-the-constitution-experts-ncp-leaders/\" target=\"_blank\">[10] https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/oli-govt-s-appointments-are-a-mockery-of-the-constitution-experts-ncp-leaders/</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/10/10/amid-continuing-differences-over-appointments-cabinet-reshuffle-may-be-pushed-back-further\" target=\"_blank\">[11] https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/10/10/amid-continuing-differences-over-appointments-cabinet-reshuffle-may-be-pushed-back-further</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2020/11/906734\" target=\"_blank\">[12] https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2020/11/906734</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.recordnepal.com/category-explainers/a-heavy-handed-central-government-continues-to-undermine-the-spirit-of-federalism/\" target=\"_blank\">[13] https://www.recordnepal.com/category-explainers/a-heavy-handed-central-government-continues-to-undermine-the-spirit-of-federalism/</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Mahesh Kumar Kushwaha', '/uploads/banner_image/1671354532_flag-2528941_1280-100x126.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12-03', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 20:53:52', '2022-12-18 20:53:52'),

It has become an important tool in limiting the disease’s spread. Therefore, the Health Ministry enforcing a Cabinet decision to roll back on free COVID-19 testing and treatment of patients (except for the poor, single women, disabled, senior citizens above 70 years, frontline health workers, security personnel and cleaning staffers) on October 17 courted controversy. [1]Following the announcement, state-run laboratories stopped free tests and health workers assigned to carry out contact tracing stopped collecting nasal and throat swabs for polymerase chain reaction tests. The decision to halt free test, trace, and treatment came amidst spiking number of infections in the country and was heavily criticized by experts as irresponsible and unacceptable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government’s decision to not bear the cost of COVID-19 tests and treatment also affected health workers tasked with contact tracing. [2]According to them, following the announcement, infected individuals responded in anger and even refused to cooperate when rung up and inquired about their health status. [3]Experts have long stressed that contact tracing and testing are essential components of the toolbox for containing a disease outbreak. This is especially true for a disease such as COVID-19, which can be spread by people who have no symptoms. Furthermore, since the efficacy of contact tracing relies on information provided by infected individuals, without their cooperation, it is rendered ineffective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having to pay for tests and treatments out of their own pockets can be a real financial barrier for many people and can also become the reason they decide against being tested. [4]Public health experts expressed that this will not only discourage individuals from seeking tests and treatment, leading to reduced testing but will also ultimately result in further spread of the virus. The government’s decision in this context appears counterproductive, risking making the pandemic even more difficult to control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Health Ministry reversed its decision to discontinue free tests and treatment two weeks later and announced that it will begin running free tests based on contact tracing. However, public health experts argue that if the continued spike in cases and fatalities are any indication, the damage has been done and the COVID-19 situation in the country has already aggravated. To make matters worse, the unavailability of beds in hospitals even for serious cases has not only put immense pressure on a health system that is already buckling under the pressure of a pandemic but has also compelled infected individuals to isolate at home without the guarantee of access to treatment should they require it. [5]Experts argue that the current chaos and confusion is a result of ignoring international guidelines issued by the WHO and other experts, overlooking scientific evidence, and the overall poor handling of the COVID-19 crisis since it first started unravelling in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of a vaccine for COVID-19 has constantly been in the news but it is yet to take any shape. Therefore, it is imperative that until a vaccine is successfully formulated, international guidelines to mitigate and control the infection such as contact tracing, testing, and treatment be made a continued priority. [6]The World Health Organization’s director general recently said that when leaders act quickly and deliberately, the spread can be curbed. However, political division at the national level and blatant disrespect for science and health professionals has created confusion while cases and deaths have mounted. Acknowledging that the COVID-19 crisis in Nepal is growing, testing should not be treated as a scarce resource and the government should further strengthen the efforts to contain the virus instead of backpedalling on the few measures that would help mitigate its spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/10/22/after-rolling-back-free-testing-and-treatment-officials-not-responding-to-distress-calls\" target=\"_blank\">[1] https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/10/22/after-rolling-back-free-testing-and-treatment-officials-not-responding-to-distress-calls</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/10/21/angry-with-decision-not-to-treat-them-COVID-19-infected-refuse-to-cooperate-health-workers-say\" target=\"_blank\">[2] https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/10/21/angry-with-decision-not-to-treat-them-COVID-19-infected-refuse-to-cooperate-health-workers-say</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/COVID-19-story-tip-the-importance-of-contact-tracing\" target=\"_blank\">[3] https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/COVID-19-story-tip-the-importance-of-contact-tracing</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.journal-news.net/journal-news/COVID-19-testing-should-be-free-to-all/article_32b8e9f1-72cd-53bf-8e8c-f531b8486274.html\" target=\"_blank\">[4] https://www.journal-news.net/journal-news/COVID-19-testing-should-be-free-to-all/article_32b8e9f1-72cd-53bf-8e8c-f531b8486274.html</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/11/02/in-a-u-turn-health-ministry-now-says-it-will-run-free-tests-based-on-contact-tracing\" target=\"_blank\">[5] https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/11/02/in-a-u-turn-health-ministry-now-says-it-will-run-free-tests-based-on-contact-tracing</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-COVID-19%E2%80%94-26-october-2020\" target=\"_blank\">[6] https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-COVID-19%E2%80%94-26-october-2020</a></li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Shuvangi Poudyal', '/uploads/banner_image/1671354771_covid-test-19-5057462_1280-100x36.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12-03', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 20:57:51', '2022-12-18 20:57:51');

However, the vulnerable group endures its impact differently in the social sphere. The implications of COVID-19 go beyond the health of an individual and include economic, social, mental implications as well. The global crisis has deepened society’s impoverishment, which has further given rise to myriad social problems such as domestic violence, sexual exploitation, labor exploitation, and cybercrimes. Unfortunately, women usually are at the receiving end of all social issues. Especially in the patriarchal social structure, women are always the ones to suffer more during a crisis or otherwise. It is quite evident with several instances in the past few months; the pandemic has doubly hit women in many different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domestic Violence</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The country was under a complete lockdown in the wake of COVID-19 from March 24 to June 15, 2020, to contain the virus. The lockdown compelled the women in an abusive household to confine themselves with their abusive partners within the four walls. There was no a proper redressal mechanism in place in the initial phase of the lockdown, leaving no recourse to the women living in a harsh environment. It exposed women to a higher risk of physical and sexual exploitation every day. Nepal was already fighting against gender-based violence; the COVID crisis has further fostered violence against women in the lockdown. The reported domestic violence cases have risen drastically in the last few months since the beginning of the lockdown.[1] National Women Commission has stated that they received 1,267 complaints from the Gender-based violence survivors.[2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Achham has reported a surged number of domestic violence cases. As per the police, owing to the pandemic returnee’s migrant workers from various countries are jobless and indulge in alcohol consumption and assault their wives at home.[3] During the lockdown period, 39 domestic violence cases were reported in Achham.[4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rising crimes against women</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with significant escalation in domestic violence cases, other crimes against women have also risen exponentially. Women’s safety has forever been an issue in Nepal, where the culture of victim-blaming and shaming is highly prevalent. A 17-year-old rape victim committed suicide because the Panchayat in the village prevented her from reporting the crime to the police. They compelled the victim to dispose of the matter without approaching the Court, as disclosing the case in public would stain their reputation and bring disgrace in the community.[5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rape has significantly increased in the past few months; women and girls are not safe even inside their homes, let alone the security issue outside their houses. The lockdown has further made women and girls experience the worst forms of sexual violence from familiar people. Intrafamilial sexual abuse has come out to be a pressing issue during the lockdown. For instance, police arrested a 40-year-old man, resident of New Baneshore, repeatedly raping his seven-year-old daughter for seven months.[6] The incident got disclosed after the victim told her mother about the pain in her private parts.[7] In such cases, victims are more helpless when they fall prey to sexual abuse by their family members. The victim’s traumatic experience takes a tremendous toll on their mental, emotional, and physical health as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the government has failed to ensure safe isolation centers for women. A 31-year old woman in Kailali district was raped in the isolation center by the volunteers working there.[8] The government has neglected to take account of women’s issues and failed to provide safe women-friendly quarantines. Women have to fight for their basic human rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reproductive health</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has majorly hit maternity health; pregnant women and postpartum mothers are more vulnerable. Reproductive health is highly compromised in this unprecedented time. The increasing maternity death rate in the past few months are concerning. Especially in rural areas, women do not have access to hospitals and health care services. Eighty-five pregnant women have lost their lives due to non-institutional childbirth, unable to access hospital timely, Covid-19 induced anxiety, and complications during delivery, especially in rural areas.[9] Lack of prenatal and postnatal care has also led to a hike in maternal mortality and caused infant mortality. Besides, women are deprived of access to family planning services and other aspects of reproductive health.[10]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In two months, Banke district has reported seven maternity mortality cases. District Health Office states that the causes of deaths are irregular and lack of proper on-time treatments during pregnancy and post-delivery.[11] Furthermore, the hospitals refusing to admit pregnant women who urgently need health services led to a pregnant woman’s death in Biratnagar.[12] Women are losing their lives due to denial of their reproductive rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pandemic underlining gender disparity</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID crisis has amplified the existing gender-inequality in society. Women are bearing the brunt of the global pandemic. The employment of women has stumbled more as compared to men since the beginning of the crisis. Thus, women have been more prone to human trafficking because of their circumstances created by the pandemic.[13] This has become an opportunity for traffickers to bait women by promising to provide jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to this, women are entrusted with more household responsibilities. They are expected to be caregivers in the family. The enforcement of lockdown has doubled the burdens on the shoulder of women. The pandemic has reinforced Nepali households’ gender roles due to their allegiance to the deep-seated patriarchal norms. This has further fostered gender disparity in seeking education. In Nepal, a survey conducted by a Room to Read Nepal has found that 279 girls out of 3,992 girls from 11 districts said they would be unable to re-join the school once it resumes. [14]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women’s issues are often trivialized and received with little attention. Women have to fight for their fundamental rights. Moreover, the disparity between the genders is not a new phenomenon. Our social structure is such that it always puts women in a more vulnerable position. It appears that more than the pandemic, it is the social behaviour towards women that has majorly caused them to suffer more than ever during this stressful time. The COVID crisis has merely unravelled the bleak realities of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0;\">\r\n	<li><a

These episodes indicate that while Nepal is willing to cross diplomatic norms to please China, the opposite is the case for US and India. At the international fora, Nepal has sought to emphasize multilateralism and revive the SAARC process. Relations with India, however, remain problematic despite continuity of development assistance. In the meantime, Nepal has tried to push forward closer cooperation with China. In the area of trade and investment, the current environment appears to favor China and Russia more than it does the US and India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Nepal at the international fora</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prime Minister K P Oli made several speeches at the UN and related meetings. In his pre-recorded speech to the UN General Assembly, he highlighted current problems in the international order and emphasized the need for multilateralism.[1] He spoke on the theme of “reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism,” “rules-based order” and “reform of WTO,” among others. He indirectly criticized the US saying, “it is unfortunate that we witness in some quarters lesser desire to work under the multilateral framework.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The language Nepal uses in discussing the international order and international issues resembles Chinese foreign policy discourse. While support for multilateralism, rules-based order and the UN system is reasonable and rational, using the langauge and terminology used by China portrays Nepal’s affinity to China in its views about international relations and is critical of the US. The PM however, also supported the Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT), which is being pushed by India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the chair of SAARC, Nepal is trying to jumpstart the regional cooperation process that has stalled, primarily due to differences between India and Pakistan. However, greater regional cooperation may not be possible without a willingness to address substantial issues linked to geo-strategic conflict, identities, and terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A virtual meeting of SAARC Council of Ministers, chaired by Nepal, was held on September 24, where Nepal urged member states to hold the 19th summit as soon as possible.[2] The last SAARC Summit was held in Nepal in 2014, and Nepal said “the formal mechanisms of the SAARC must function properly” and that “the early holding of the 19th Summit has become imperative.”[3] India emphasized its commitment to SAARC and its contribution to combating Covid 19 pandemic. Dr Jaishankar concluded by saying that the “scourge of terrorism, including the forces that nurture, support and encourage and environment of terror and conflict” have impeded the objective of SAARC.[4] Pakistan’s foreign Minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan is willing to host the next Summit and asked for “obstacles created in its way to be removed for SAARC to function as an effective instrument of regional cooperation.”[5] Pakistan was supposed to host the SAARC meeting in November 2016 but the meet was postponed after India raised issues linked to terrorism, and Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Bhutan followed suit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Nepal and India</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minister for Education Giriraj Mani Pokharel was personally involved in producing a reference textbook[6] intended to educate high school students about Nepal’s border disputes with India, which contains language that spreads negativity about India. According to the Director General of Curriculum Development Center, the book was published with the consent of the prime minister and other concerned ministries. This indicates Nepal’s willingness to take India headlong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal is setting up more border observation posts along its border with India after disputes over the Lipulekh area. About 15 BOPs have been set up by the Armed Police Force after the dispute. The APF has plans to increase the posts to 500. Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa Badal has been assessing the situation in Nepal’s border districts, especially Darchula and said on September 26 that the government will bring special packages for the residents living along the border.[7] While Nepal has the right to protect its borders, the manner in which Nepal is addressing the border disputes with India is creating greater rift between India and Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these developments, Nepal’s ambassador to India Nilambar Acharya met India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on September 7 as part of efforts to revive dialogue between Nepal and India.[8]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closure of the border between India and Nepal has disrupted the flow of people, which in turn is creating severe hardships for people dependent on cross-border relations for livelihoods. While the government is embroiled in border disputes and political differences with India, many Nepali people dependent on India for livelihood are troubled by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Nepali migrant workers, for example, are now flooding back to India despite the risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepali migrant workers are now flooding back to India. According to Kantipur, about 422 thousand Nepalis have already returned to India, mostly from Sudur Paschim province.[9] More than nine lakh Nepalis had returned to Nepal from India after the COVID-19 pandemic. Those without identity cards are forced to travel through less controlled border points. For example, in the last four weeks, some 22,000 Nepali migrant workers with India-issued ration cards have returned to India from Nepalganj, and those without identity cards are travelling through other points like Kailali’s Trinagar.[10]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal-India border will remain sealed until November 14. Border forces of the two countries have initiated joint security patrol in certain districts, including Kapilvastu, to control illegal crossings and criminal activities.[11] The closed border has severely affected businesses and businesses in Birganj want to open the border even if it requires extreme caution.[12]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite disputes and differences, India’s development assistance to Nepal continues. There were two major highlights last month, including India’s support to Nepal in its fight against COVID-19 and the grant of two trains. The arrival of trains from India symbolized several elements in Nepal including Nepal’s aspirations for a greater railway network, and the lack of progress in Nepal-China cross-border railways, and Nepal government’s inefficiency in managing railways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal received 2000 vials of Remdesivir from India. While receiving the medicine, Nepal cast it[13] in terms of the “commitment of SAARC leaders to work together for the fighting of the pandemic,” while the Indian government described it as Indian government’s ongoing assistance to Nepal as a close friend and neighbour. Similarly, India’s India’s Konkan Railway provided two trains to Nepal, but given Nepal’s lack of preparation, the trains are yet to be operational. The railway will operate on a 34-km line between Jayanagar, India and Janakpur, Nepal. The railway line was converted from narrow gauge to wide gauge in 2018 and the route is expected to extend to Bardibas, some 36 kms from Janakpur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C. Nepal and China</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal is slowly pushing forward Nepal’s existing agreements with China. Although bottlenecks remain, there are significant incentives for Nepali actors to pursue closer relationship with China. Nepal’s Ambassador to China Mahendra Pandey said his priority is to implement the agreements between the two countries signed during Xi Jinping’s visit. “Both sides have been working very hard” for the China-Nepal railway project, and “work will accelerated once the pandemic is controlled,” he said.[14]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent months, Indian media has been reporting and highlighting issues seeking to amplify differences between Nepal and China. The Indian media, citing intelligence agencies, claimed China was also “fomenting anti-India protests along the Indo-Nepal border.”[15] Nepal Members of parliament in India are concerned about Nepal’s growing ties to China in terms of transit and transportation and how these developments are affecting Nepal’s relationship with India.[16]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue has piqued Chinese media and experts. For example, Global Times, in one of its reports said, Indian media is “spreading fake news and rumors to hype China’s threat, or add fuel to nationalism.” One of the examples cited was the report in Indian media that China had encroached Nepal’s territory. ” The Times quoted Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and commentator: “It is India that always thinks it dominates Nepal, and by hyping China’s ‘invasion’ of Nepal, India is making itself an excuse to enter into Nepal to control the country.”[17] Chinese media have also raised concerns that western NGOs in Nepal are fueling anti-China voices.[18]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government issued a press statement clarifying that Nepal has no border dispute with China and that the Chinese construction close to the boundary pillars 11 and 12 in Humla were well within the Chinese territory.[19] However, local continue to claim the disputed land clearly falls inside Nepali territory and the issue can be resolved only after locating the missing boundary pillar.[20]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese media also tried to address these issues through an interview of Nepal’s ambassador to China, Mahendra Pandey.[21] He said we have long standing border disputes with India, stemming from the 1962 war between India and China, but not with China. He said Nepal had requested India for dialogue many times but India did not show interest, until now. Nepal’s Ambassador to China, like many other politicians in Nepal, speaks the language of Chinese diplomacy, eg, terms like unilateralism versus multilateralism, the importance of collectivism, freedom versus preciousness of people’s lives. His interviews to the Global Times raised controversy and experts raised questions about whether he’s supposed to represent Nepal’s interests or speak for Chinese interests.[22] His interview also showed that Nepali diplomats and politicians are not afraid of offending India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal and China have resumed meeting to discuss operationalisation of transport agreement, protocol and trade facilitation by building infrastructure, including a Nepal-China Cross Border Economic Zone and roads.[23] Border points between Nepal and China had remained closed due to “snowfall” and Covid 19 pandemic and the main transit point, Rasuwagadhi-Gyirong was opened on September 24 after remaining more than eight months (except for a three-week window in between). The border was opened after demands from traders who want to supply goods for the upcoming holidays.[24]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Foreign Direct Investment and financial flows</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In line with the report of the party’s task force[25], the two co-chairs of the NCP agreed on September 10 to ratify the MCC Agreement only after amendments.[26] Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali said the MCC project is necessary for Nepal and the agreement will be approved even if it needs revisions on certain points.[27] The government and the NCP will be unable to circumvent the recommendations of the party’s task force on MCC. Given the way in which the recommendations are phrased, the government may seek to first “clarify” the provisions—one way is through exchange of letters—rather than amend the agreement itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Department of State’s new report 2020 Investment Climate Statements: Nepal released says[28] “significant barriers to investment remain” given “political instability, widespread corruption, cumbersome bureaucracy, and inconsistent implementation of laws and regulations.” Similarly, a report prepared by Center for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) based on FINCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) files showed involvement of Nepali entities and individuals in suspicious financial transactions. According to Times of India, the report “shows the involvement of Nepali companies and banks attempting to deceive US sanctions on trade especially on Iran and China.”[29]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given Nepal’s current investment climate and corruption, businesses from China and Russia are likely to gain more foothold in Nepal compared to those from US and India. These financial incentives, in turn, are more likely to skew Nepal’s foreign policy toward China and Russia in the future. Such tilt will not be reflected in official policies, but the financial interests and incentives will significantly affect the environment and practice for foreign policy. Revelations from the FINCEN Files show that the financial interests in Nepal may well be connected to illicit financial flows, especially in countries that turn a blind eye to financial irregularities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepal’s economic and financial ties with China is growing, and this is likely to add momentum to Nepal-China relations. Chinese FDI pledge has increased this year despite the Covid 19 pandemic. The pledge this year amounted to more than $220 million, while it was $116 million last year. According to Xinhua, investment in hydropower projects has led to the surge.[30] China has remained the largest contributor to FDI since the last five years. Meanwhile, Chinese companies are hopeful of selling electric buses to Nepal government, which has decided to procure 300 electric buses.[31]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E. A new entrant: Russia</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia has emerged as a new entrant to geo-political competition in Nepal with its vaccine diplomacy. Given its interests and willingness to adopt a “double game” policy vis-a-vis India and China and restore its former status, it is expected to enhance its economic interests in Nepal.[32] Russia has strong ties with Nepal’s private sector and it has good prospects in energy, infrastructure, mining and civil aviation.[33] It is already expanding its influence in India, Sri Lanka,[34] and Pakistan.[35]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), announced[36] on September 29 that it had “agreed to supply 25 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccines to Nepal via Trinity Pharmaceuticals, a private healthcare firm. Kishore Adhikari, Director of Trinity Pharmaceuticals stated in the RDIF press release: ““We are pleased to announce our cooperation with the Russian Direct Investment Fund. We are looking forward to the results of the final phase of the Sputnik V vaccine trial. As soon as the vaccine is approved by the Government of Nepal, we are ready to immediately provide it to the population of the country.” Following up the reports, The Kathmandu Post, however said Nepal’s government entities were unaware of such a development.[37] In an interview with Naya Patrika, Adhikari said they had signed an agreement with the Russian government with the help of the Russian Embassy and they would fulfill due process before importing the vaccine.[38]</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a

(3038, 'nepals-struggling-democracy', 'nepalsstrugglingdemocracy', 'Nepal’s Struggling Democracy', NULL, 'Home', 'News Digest', NULL, 32, 'Winston Churchill once said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.” On a global scale', NULL, '<p>September Analysis</p>\r\n<p>Winston Churchill once said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.” On a global scale, Churchill’s quote holds more valid today than, perhaps, ever before. Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Jair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi, and even KP Sharma Oli are only a few examples of the leaders who have effectively hijacked democracy by employing its very channels and means. Minority rights, civic liberty, media freedom, constitutional supremacy, and the rule of law have taken a backseat while these leaders forward their populist agendas in the name of national security, economic performance, and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. With an impressive degree of skillfulness, leaders worldwide have exploited the unprecedented situation and democracy’s limitations and loopholes to solidify their rule, in a process hurting democracy irreparably. On this account, Nepal’s infant democracy has been struggling under a powerful communist government and an ambitious prime minister.</p>\r\n<p>The first and the most vital challenge to Nepal’s democracy comes from the country’s ruling communist party. While the country was reeling under a deadly pandemic, Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was busy in an intra-party feud over power-sharing,[1] not to mention several corruption scandals related to the COVID-19 management and controversial appointments. While corruption, irregularity, and favoritism already erode the culture of democracy and meritocracy, the spillover of the party’s internal dispute has made a mockery of Nepal’s democracy. NCP’s internal struggle culminated in a truce between Pushpa Kamal Dahal and KP Sharma Oli,[2] leading to Bamdev Gautam’s appointment to the National Assembly (NA).[3] Gautam’s appointment to the NA shattered Prime Minister Oli’s strong desire to continue Dr. Yuvaraj Khatiwada as the finance minister by re-appointing him to the NA. Nevertheless, in a rather surprising manner, PM Oli appointed Khatiwada as his special economic advisor while keeping the finance ministry under himself.[4] These moves collectively show NCP’s lack of commitment to preserving Nepal’s democracy and PM Oli’s determination to cement his authority irrespective of constitutional breaches.</p>\r\n<p>Bamdev Gautam lost the federal legislative election from Bardiya, which constitutionally bars him from being a minister.[5] However, the constitution also allows an individual sworn in as a member of the National Assembly to be a minister.[6] Amidst an ongoing discussion about appointing Gautam as a minister, a writ was filed at the Supreme Court questioning these moves’ constitutionality.[7] Although the Supreme Court has issued an interim order that temporarily blocks him from being a minister, appointing a person rejected by the people in elections is already a breach of democratic principles.[8] Supreme Court reversal and Gautam’s ministerial appointment is still not an impossible scenario after all. On the other hand, Khatiwada’s appointment as the PM’s special economic advisor makes him a de facto finance minister, which is also against the spirit of the constitution. Besides PM Oli’s past moves to curtail civil and media liberty through controversial bills and ordinances, the NCP’s internal power struggle has severely compromised Nepal’s democracy.</p>\r\n<p>While PM Oli and his party continue to jeopardize Nepal’s democracy, Nepali Congress (NC) has constantly failed to show its oppositional accountability. However, in their defense, the parliament remains shut since the president prorogued the parliament on the PM’s recommendation. This closure has stripped the opposition of the biggest platform to question the government’s actions. Nevertheless, Nepali Congress’ primary interest and focus for the past few months have been their upcoming national convention. Different conflicts and factional infighting over the party’s leadership[9][10] seems to have crippled the vision of the ‘democratic’ party, as the clashing leaders are preoccupied with their petty personal interests and political ambitions. Perhaps due to this misplaced priority, the party’s shadow government has been largely ineffective, too; holding only two meetings in the last 1.5 years, they did almost nothing during the period. In the face of struggling governance by an autocratic ruler and his communist party, NC’s silence only nurtures people’s uncertainty over Nepal’s democratic future; Nepali people are fed up with corruption, a broken justice system, and police brutality.</p>\r\n<p>Nepal’s justice system is broken; instead of working for the people, its instruments have cracked down on them, showing major compliance in the state oppression and brutality. The worst victims have been historically oppressed and minority groups. For instance, after the murder of Dalit victims in Rukum village[11] and the government’s apparent negligence of Dalit issues, there have been several instances of police brutality against the so-called ‘lower’ caste people. The mysterious in-custody death of Shambhu Sada[12] and no serious investigation despite protests demonstrates the state’s discrimination against the poor and marginalized. Instead, there was yet another Dalit death under police custody.[13] These cases expose the authorities’ disregard for Dalit lives and paint a general picture of in-custody tortures and illegal practices. Not only behind bars, on several occasions, Nepal police have terrorized the streets by mercilessly beating silent protestors,[14] arresting by-standers, and abducting the much-revered Satyagrahi doctor.[15] All in all, people, have been either a victim of this brutality or a spectator wise enough to understand that this is not what democracy looks like.</p>\r\n<p>The rule of law, minority rights, freedom of expression, and media freedom, which are some of the most crucial elements of liberal democracy, are all under assault in Nepal’s current scenario. This democratic backsliding is particularly challenging for Nepal because the country got democracy after years of struggle not so long ago, and this new system is yet to be consolidated here. Besides the external threats, the political class’s greed and personal ambitions and determination to quash any voice that disturbs the existing status quo or challenges their access to power and resources act as a significant impediment to Nepal’s democracy. As a result, people witnessing power struggle, corruption, oppression, and brutality have started developing a distrust for democracy; some have even begun to feel nostalgia for monarchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0;\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/09/21/ruling-party-fight-was-for-power-sharing-and-it-has-become-apparent-experts-and-analysts-say\" target=\"_blank\">[1]https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2020/09/21/ruling-party-fight-was-for-power-sharing-and-it-has-become-apparent-experts-and-analysts-say</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/51023/2020-09-12\" target=\"_blank\">[2]https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/51023/2020-09-12</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://deshsanchar.com/2020/09/16/413305/\" target=\"_blank\">[3]https://deshsanchar.com/2020/09/16/413305/</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/17/oli-s-preferential-treatment-to-khatiwada-may-impact-governance\" target=\"_blank\">[4]https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/17/oli-s-preferential-treatment-to-khatiwada-may-impact-governance</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[5]Article 78.4 of the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">[6]Article 76.9 of the Constitution of Nepal, 2015.</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/21/writ-at-supreme-court-demands-annulment-of-gautam-s-appointment-to-national-assembly\" target=\"_blank\">[7]https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/21/writ-at-supreme-court-demands-annulment-of-gautam-s-appointment-to-national-assembly</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/24/supreme-court-blocks-bamdev-gautam-s-way-to-cabinet-for-now\" target=\"_blank\">[8]https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/09/24/supreme-court-blocks-bamdev-gautam-s-way-to-cabinet-for-now</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/09/05/159926573001578090.html\" target=\"_blank\">[9]https://ekantipur.com/news/2020/09/05/159926573001578090.html</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/51675/2020-09-22\" target=\"_blank\">[10]https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/51675/2020-09-22</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/dalit-killings-in-rukum-village-spark-outrage-over-caste-discrimination/\" target=\"_blank\">[11]https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/dalit-killings-in-rukum-village-spark-outrage-over-caste-discrimination/</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2020/06/14/in-custody-death-of-a-musahar-man-sparks-protests-in-janakpur\" target=\"_blank\">[12]https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2020/06/14/in-custody-death-of-a-musahar-man-sparks-protests-in-janakpur</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/08/28/yet-another-dalit-death-spotlights-culture-of-torture-in-police-custody\" target=\"_blank\">[13] ttps://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/08/28/yet-another-dalit-death-spotlights-culture-of-torture-in-police-custody</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/policemen-who-beat-up-civilian-at-babarmahal-on-thursday-to-be-investigated/?categoryId=blog\" target=\"_blank\">[14]https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/policemen-who-beat-up-civilian-at-babarmahal-on-thursday-to-be-investigated/?categoryId=blog</a> </li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/why-have-i-been-abducted-asks-dr-kc/\" target=\"_blank\">[15]https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/why-have-i-been-abducted-asks-dr-kc/</a> </li>\r\n</ul>', NULL, 2991, NULL, NULL, 'Mahesh Kumar Kushwaha', '/uploads/banner_image/1671356357_thumb-100x67.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-12-02', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12-18 21:24:17', '2022-12-18 21:24:17'),

In addition to this, President Bhandari focused on implications of climate change in Nepal and called for global support to help the country deal with the climate change related challenges. Sima Bahous, Executive Director of the UN Women expressed her appreciation towards Nepal’s growth on women empowerment. Participating in such events paves a way for communication with the international community and helps to disseminate a message regarding the progress made by the country in any sector.

The visit lasted for 5 days. Although the visit was claimed to be mainly for personal purpose – to observe heritage sites built by China<br />\r\n– Nepal government, however, was reluctant about the visit at the eve of election. Despite government’s hesitations, Chinese embassy insisted the visit and confirmed delegates’ arrival. Officials at the PMO said that Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba restrained from meeting foreign dignitaries and was also against receiving foreign visitors due to election campaign schedules. The Embassy of Nepal in Beijing were unaware about the visit which is reflective of negligence on the part of the embassy. The government should have undertaken necessary steps to not allow high- profile visits at the eve of the election – and the government should have formally communicated through the embassy to postpone such visits. The failure to do so reveals carelessness on the government’s part as well.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Nepal Army awards controversial Chinese contractors</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\nOn November 11, 2022, Nepal Army (NA) awarded the contract to construct Kathmandu-Tarai- Madhes Expressway (Fast Track) to a controversial Chinese contractor company. In the global tenders, out of 12 companies that submitted their proposals, 5 were selected but China First Highway Engineering company was not on the list. The company then had filed a complaint to the Public Procurement Review Committee saying that it was unfair to be <a href=\"https://english.khabarhub.com/2022/14/280217/\">not allowed</a> to participate in the tender. After the complaint was filed, submission of financial proposal was delayed. The review committee of Public Procurement then asked NA to allow the Chinese company to participate - it is speculated that this move could have been undertaken under the Chinese influence. It comes as a surprise that the same company which was disqualified by the NA has now been awarded with the contract to construct the fast-track project. According the OnlineKhabar, the NA gave <a href=\"https://english.khabarhub.com/2022/14/280217/\">Letter of Intent</a> to the controversial company under the pressure from Manoj Krishna Sapkota who is the chairman of the committee. The Chinese manipulation in the bidding process and Nepalese government unable to take a stand could turn out to be an economic loss to Nepal. This is just one among many cases in which China has tried to manipulate the decision-making process.

As for the provincial parliament, a total of 15 women candidates <a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/fptp-female-participation-too-poor\">won</a>.<br />\r\nOnly a few women were provided with FPTP tickets by the political parties - 9.3% of total candidates nominated for the federal parliament and 8.7% of the total candidates <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2022/11/ahead-of-nepals-election-many-decry-the-lack-of-choice/\">nominated</a> for the provincial assemblies. CPN UML, being the party with the highest number fielding women candidates, nominated 11 women candidates while CPN (Maoist Center) fielded seven and Nepali Congress, five. CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Janamorcha Party <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/women-candidates-in-hor-and-pa-elections-of-2079-bs/\">nominated</a> one each. Thus unsurprisingly, only a handful of women got elected.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOn the other hand, even prominent women candidates couldn’t pull off FPTP victories. Nepali Congress (NC) Joint General Secretary, Mahalakshmi Upadhyay from Makwanpur-1, former Deputy Speaker Pushpa Bhusal from Arghakhanchi, Deputy General Secretary and Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, Pampha Bhusal from Lalitpur 3, former speaker Onsari Gharti from Kathmandu 2, secretary of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and former Minister for Urban Development, Ram Kumari Jhakri from Gulmi-2, all faced defeat. Prominent young female candidates, namely, Manushi Yami Bhattarai and Ranju Darshana also <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/women-candidates-in-hor-and-pa-elections-of-2079-bs/\">lost</a> the election from Kathmandu 2 and 5 respectively.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">Misuse of Proportional Representation</h2>\r\nAs affairs of electoral coalitions became the major priority of mainstream political parties, other electoral agendas - especially inclusion - took a backseat. Beginning from the nomination, parties merely followed obligatory constitutional provisions, whilst lacking in their true commitment toward inclusion.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs seen in the case of the Nepali Congress (NC), which nominated one of the lowest percentages of women candidates, and is now having to fulfill the quota through the Party-list Proportional Representation (PR). The Nepali Congress has 99 members in the federal parliament - 89 in the Lower House and 10 in the Upper House. Out of 57 members of the federal parliament elected directly, only one is female and of 10 members in the National Assembly, 3 of them are women. And since one-third of total members of the parliament should be women, this compels the Nepali Congress to nominate at least 29 females under the PR category.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe November election also saw the misuse and manipulation of <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2022/11/ahead-of-nepals-election-many-decry-the-lack-of-choice/\">Proportional Representation system</a> by influential patrons. While proportional representation is envisioned to ensure inclusion of underrepresented groups, it has been occupied by elite leaders of the likes of Arju Deuba, Bimalendra Nidhi and Prakash Sharan Mahat, among others. As now the NC will only be able to send three male candidates through the PR category, it can be speculated that the seats allocated for different inclusionary clusters will be occupied by those leaders who have been in the forefront of politics.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nA similar case can be observed in provinces - a total of 14 women have been elected through the FPTP in seven different provincial assemblies, while none were elected directly (FPTP) in Karnali and Sudhurpaschim Provinces. So, in order to meet the 33% quota of women candidates, at least 181 women should be in the provincial parliament, which means 167 women representatives will have to be <a href=\"https://www.nayapatrikadaily.com/news-details/101945/2022-12-05\">selected</a> from the Proportional Representation in total.<br />\r\nAround 62 out of 126 <a href=\"https://tkpo.st/3VtDNLT\">ethnic groups</a> in the country have never been represented in the parliament, as per a yet-to-be published report by the National Inclusion Commission, a constitutional body. The goal of the Proportional Representation system is to bring the diversity of society to the parliament. However, time and again, political leaders have capitalized on the existing loopholes for their individual gain or have simply chosen not to prioritize inclusion. This was also echoed in &nbsp;the local election of May 2022, when political parties chose not to ensure women’s representation in either of the two top posts of each local body, as there are no <a href=\"https://tkpo.st/3VtDNLT\">constitutional norms</a> to abide by for coalitions like individual parties.<br />\r\nFurthermore, the representation of Dalit and Janajatis have also been low. Thirty-five Janajatis and one Dalit have won the federal parliament seats under the FPTP. Now through the PR system, 15 Dalit members will have to be elected to meet the 13.8% seats <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/11/30/new-house-of-representatives-to-be-less-inclusive\">allotted</a> based on the 2011 national census, meaning a total of 16 Dalit representatives (or 5.8%) will be in the 275-member parliament. Since the election of 2008, this has been the lowest representation of Dalits in Parliament. Unlike women, there are no binding laws for the representation of other marginalized groups; furthermore, Dalits and Janajatis themselves lack the confidence and funds, borne from structural discrimination, to contest via FPTP resulting in a vicious cycle of <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/11/30/new-house-of-representatives-to-be-less-inclusive\">under representation</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">No Reservation for Tharu Community</h2>\r\nOn November 6, the supreme court ruled that the Tharu community will no longer get reservations in the country’s civil service commission. A division bench of justices ruled that the Tharu community did not need a separate quota as its members can also compete in the Madhesi and Janajati categories.

However, in recent times, electricity has been one of the major exports from Nepal to India. Not just with India, but Nepal and Bangladesh have also reached an understanding to carry out power trade via India. This is reflective of rise in demand of Nepal’s electricity in the Indian subcontinent. If the agreement materializes, and Nepal becomes able to trade electricity via India to Bangladesh and other nations in the region, Nepal could earn a huge amount of foreign currency which in turn would help Nepal to reduce its massive trade deficit.&nbsp;\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">Import ban on Nepal</h2>\r\n&nbsp;The government of Nepal banned the import of 10 \"luxury goods\" since early May after experiencing a severe depletion in foreign reserves and a widening trade deficit. Though this step has improved the economy\'s external sector, its spill-over effects have surfaced in other arenas of the economy. The trade deficit has been reduced, and foreign exchange reserves have increased. In the first three months of this fiscal year (2022–23), the gross foreign exchange reserves of the NRB increased by 2.5 percent to Rs. 1246.22 billion from Rs. 1215.80 billion in mid–July 2022. The overall trade deficit <a href=\"https://www.nrb.org.np/contents/uploads/2022/11/Current-Macroeconomic-and-Financial-Situation-Nepali-Based-on-%20Three-Months-data-of-2079.80.pdf\">was reduced</a> by 13.1% to Rs. 359.18 billion during the review period after rising by 58.3% during the same period the year before.<br />\r\nAlthough the government has tightened the import of goods, including spices, chocolate, alcohol, and clothes, these goods have <a href=\"https://epaper.ekantipur.com/kantipur/2022-11-09\">entered</a> Nepal without proper documentation or through illegal channels. Most of the goods restricted from importing can be seen in the Nepali market, inferring the entry of goods through illegal routes. The automobile sector has been hit severely as various vehicle showrooms have been <a href=\"https://epaper.ekantipur.com/kantipur/2022-11-05\">shut down</a> across the country due to the restrictions on the import.<br />\r\nIt is high time for Nepal to review its import restrictions. International Monetary Fund (IMF) has &nbsp;delayed the loan installment to Nepal questioning government’s move to lengthen import restrictions – and had suggested to <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2022/11/24/nepal-reviewing-import-ban-after-imf-%20prodding#:~:text=The%20directive%20issued%20on%20April,than%20150%20cc%20were%20banned.\">employ</a> other monetary measures in dealing with the foreign exchange reserve issues.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">Election 2022 Expenditure</h2>\r\n&nbsp;Nepal held its second federal and provincial election on November 20, 2022. Elections these days have become a costly affair. While in 2017, the government spent Rs 8 billion for federal and provincial polls, this time round, <a href=\"https://b360nepal.com/cost-of-elections-and-who-pays-for-it/\">expenditure</a> for the same reached Rs. 10 billion.<br />\r\nNot only the administrative cost of the elections raised significantly, but the candidates also spent massive amounts. The Election Commission (EC) has set a spending cap for candidates to reduce odds of electoral results being influenced by monetary factor.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nDespite this provision at place, candidates are found to be spending more than the ceiling set by the EC. The Asia Foundation\'s study shows that in the <a href=\"https://asiafoundation.org/publication/study-on-the-election-campaign-finance-local-provincial-and-federal-elections-in-%20nepal-2017/\">2017 polls</a>, candidates spent up to 136 percent more than the imposed ceiling. These expenses are hidden or ambiguous, and candidates more often than not manipulate their spending information.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWith the<a href=\"https://nepal.ec-undp-electoralassistance.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2018/12/ec-undp-jtf-nepal-resources-%20publications-election-code-of-conduct-2015.pdf\"> ban</a> on the use, sale, and distribution of symbolic materials with logos on caps, t-shirts, etc., in election campaigns, candidates have spent quite a lot of money on advertisements on different social media platforms.

A Nepali resident can <a href=\"https://www.nrb.org.np/contents/uploads/2021/03/Prepaid-card.pdf\">spend</a> 500 dollars per year with a dollar card.&nbsp;However, candidates have spent openly disregarding the dollar limit – suggesting the use of the informal sector to pay the amount in dollars.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">Remittance: Backbone of Nepalese Economy</h2>\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAccording to the World Bank’s Migration and Brief 37 statistics, Nepal stands among the top 11 countries in the world that<a href=\"Migration%20and%20Development%20Brief%2037,%20Remittance%20Inflow%20Statistics.%20World%20Bank\"> receive</a> the most remittances in proportion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with a staggering 21.8 percent of GDP. According to NRB’s Current Macro Economic and Financial Situation in the first three months of the FY 2022/23, <a href=\"https://www.nrb.org.np/contents/uploads/2022/11/Current-Macroeconomic-and-Financial-Situation-Nepali-Based-on-%20Three-Months-data-of-2079.80.pdf\">remittance</a> in flows &nbsp;increased by 7.9 percent to USD 2.19 billion against a decrease of 7.1 percent in the same period of the previous year.<br />\r\nThis increase in remittance inflow provided a cushion to the depleting foreign exchange reserves and subsequently reduced its spill-over effects on other economic sectors. Remittance has worked as a salve for the troubled economy. Nepal, which has a GDP of 48 billion NPR, imports more than 19 billion NPR worth of goods, out of which 10 billion NPR foreign currency resources are <a href=\"https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2022/12/1228268\">contributed</a> by remittances. Remittance facilitates growth by stabilizing household consumptions in the recipient nation and could create a favorable condition for short-term economic growth.

While the election was largely peaceful barring a few incidences of violence, the voter turnout was remarkably low - <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/11/21/around-61-percent-cast-votes-in-largely-peaceful-polls\">almost 61%</a> &nbsp;in comparison to <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/11/21/frustration-with-old-guard-cited-as-main-reason-for-relatively-low-turnout\">69% in 2017</a> polls and <a href=\"3https:/english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-local-elections-over.html\">64% in local polls</a> held last May. As many as 11,543 candidates <a href=\"4https:/kathmandupost.com/national/2022/11/20/voting-begins-across-the-country-in-federal-provincial-elections\">forayed into the election</a> - for both first-past- the-post and proportional representation system for the federal parliament and seven different provincial assemblies. For <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/11/20/voting-begins-across-the-country-in-federal-provincial-elections\">165 FPTP seats of the federal parliament</a>, a total of 2,412 candidates contested - out of which 2,187 were male and 225 were female, - and for the <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/11/20/voting-begins-across-the-country-in-federal-provincial-elections\">110 proportional representation seats</a>, there are a total of 2199 candidates - 1187 female and 1012 male.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">Ruling Coalition Fails to Translate into Electoral Success</h2>\r\nThe five-party ruling coalition had forayed into the polls with a hope for a landslide victory in federal and provincial polls - however, the coalition struggled even for the magic number of 138 - a simple majority in the House of Representatives required to form the federal government. In the FPTP category, out of 165, Nepali Congress won 57, CPN Maoist Center 18, CPN Unified Socialist 10 seats, Loktrantrik Samajwadi Party 4, and Rastriya Janamorcha got 1 seat. Out of 110 Party-list Proportional Representation (PR) seats, Nepali Congress has got 32 and CPN Maoist Center 14 seats while the rest of the parties couldn’t meet three percent of minimum threshold of total votes cast under the PR category required to be eligible for PR seats. This leaves the <a href=\"7https:/election.onlinekhabar.com/\">ruling coalition with 136 seats</a>. The Nepali Congress then roped in Janamat Party with a total of 6 seats in preparation to form the government. On the opposition front, <a href=\"8%20Ibid.\">CPN UML won</a> 44 FPTP seats and 34 PR seats, Rastriya Prajatantra Party 7 FPTP seats and 7 PR seats, and Janata Samajwadi Party 7 FPTP seats, and 5 PR seats.<br />\r\nThe result was quite unexpected for the ruling coalition which had aimed to gain a clear edge against the parties in opposition. In the local polls held last May, the coalition was largely successful, and two main parties Nepali Congress and CPN Maoist Center had benefited immensely while the rest of the parties too had gained out of it. This time round, the performance of Nepali Congress is remarkably better compared to the 2017 polls when communist forces had forayed into the election together but that of the CPN Maoist Center is below par. CPN Unified Socialist formed after the split of CPN UML did even worse. Both CPN Maoist and CPN Unified Socialist have <a href=\"https://www.setopati.com/election/Parliamentary/288394\">claimed</a> that their dismal electoral performance has to do with votes of Nepali Congress not transferring to their candidates. Unlike the communist coalition of 2017, the ruling coalition was between parties with conflicting ideologies, policies and contrasting voter bases which could have had to do with the coalition failing to translate into electoral success.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/ckfinder/userfiles/images/FPTP_1672897994.jpg\" style=\"width: 753px; height: 479px;\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/ckfinder/userfiles/images/FP-PR_1672898112.jpg\" style=\"width: 695px; height: 421px;\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">A Wave of Anti-incumbency in Urban Centres and Madhes</h2>\r\nFollowing the surprise victory of quite a few independent candidates in mayoral posts in the local polls held last May, a slew of independents candidates - as many as 867 - had forayed into this election. Seizing upon the same, a media celebrity Rabi Lamichhane <a href=\"10%20https:/thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/journalist-rabi-lamichhane-announces-new-political-party\">had launched</a> a new party named Rashtriya Swatantra Party (RSP) in June. RSP has managed to win 7 federal FPTP seats, and 13 more under the proportional representation system, just twelve less seats as compared to CPN Maoist Center - a major mainstream political force. The RSP’s ideology, political agendas, plans and policies aren’t yet clear - the party had approached, seemingly in a demagogic fashion, focusing solely on issues of governance and corruption as its electoral agendas while blaming mainstream political parties for all the problems that the nation has been facing. RSP’s FPTP victories are however confined strictly within urban centers - Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Chitwan. Thus, the party’s electoral success could be read as a growing disillusionment amongst urban- middle and upper-class constituencies with the mainstream political parties.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn the Madhes region, two main parties Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) and Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) struggled to perform while two new forces Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti Party have emerged - Janamat party won 6 (1 FPTP and 5 PR) seats and Nagarik Unmukti Party secured 3 FPTP seats. The two mainstream Madhes-based parties JSP and LSP won 12 (7 FPTP and 5 PR) seats, and 4 FPTP seats respectively. The JSP had fought the election in a coalition led by the CPN UML and the LSP had joined hands with the ruling alliance - Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti Party had fought elections on their own. Janamat Party’s electoral success is also reflected in PR votes. While the LSP failed to cross the minimum threshold of 3% to be eligible for PR seats in the HoR and the Janata Samajwadi Party got 4.04% of total votes, the Janamat party has received 3.79% of the total PR votes, thereby securing 5 PR seats which is equal to the PR seats <a href=\"https://election.onlinekhabar.com/\">received</a> by the JSP.<br />\r\nLikewise, quite a few first-tier and second rung leaders of the CPN UML, CPN Maoist Center and the Nepali Congress couldn’t make it to the HoR. The JSP’s top leader Upendra Yadav lost the election from Saptari 2. CPN UML’s Ishwor Pokhrel, Shankar Pokhrel, Pradeep Gyawali, SherDhan Rai among other lost the election while Nepali Congress’s sitting minister Bal Krishna Khand, senior leader Krishna Prashad Sitaula, Bijaya Gachhadar, Sujata Koirala, Padma Narayan Chaudhary and Chitra Lekha Yadav too couldn’t make it to the HoR. Similarly, sitting minister Pampha Bhusal, Onsari Gharti, Giriraj Mani Pokharel from the Maoist Center, and ex-PM Jhala Nath Khanal from the CPN Unified Socialist were <a href=\"https://election.onlinekhabar.com/\">defeated</a>. The relatively weak performance of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madhes-based mainstream parties and the electoral failure of some senior and second-rung leaders of mainstream political parties are too indicative of the anti-incumbency wave.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">Hung Parliament Portends Instability</h2>\r\nThe largest party Nepali Congress has just 11 more seats to its nearest rival CPN UML, and no party has a clear majority in the HoR. This leaves ample room for all sorts of possible coalitions to form governments which is likely to induce instability. While the results were still trickling in, political parties began exploring different coalition possibilities to form the federal government. The Nepali Congress wishes to <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/11/27/deuba-dahal-commit-to-saving-the-alliance\">continue</a> with the current coalition and form a government under its leadership - top leaders of CPN Maoist Center and CPN Unified Socialist claim that they too wish to continue with the same coalition. However, the possibility of the communist parties coming together can’t be ruled out altogether. CPN UML’s leader KP Sharma Oli has sought to <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/left-alliance-again-after-2022-nov.html\">remend</a> his relationship with the CPN Maoist Center’s Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), &nbsp;&nbsp;and some second rung leaders of both CPN UML and CPN Maoist Center are putting efforts towards the same end. The Maoist Center too has flip-flopped on this - first it claimed that it was open to all sorts of coalitions to form the new government, and then <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/12/05/in-a-volte-face-maoists-renew-vow-to-continue-with-congress-alliance\">backtracked</a> from this position within twenty-four hours swearing allegiance to the current ruling coalition led by the Nepali Congress.The two major parties of the ruling coalition - Nepali Congress and CPN Maoist Center are said to have agreed informally to lead the government approximately for 2.5 years each in the next five year term of the HoR. Both the parties, however, wish to secure the first term of premiership which could spell trouble for the ruling coalition. On the other side, the communist parties could join hands to form a government with the support of other smaller parties if the NC- led coalition fails to do so.<br />\r\nWhichever coalition gets materialized, the hung parliament with quite a few small parties, however, heralds instability. Our experience with the hung parliament, in between 1995 to 1999, and from 2006 to 2017 wasn’t pleasant either. In these two periods, major political parties got occupied in coalition politics, forming and toppling of governments, and in horse trading of parliamentarians while good governance and development took a backseat. The smaller parties, on the other side, went through a series of splits and mergers guided with a motive of joining governments. And it was in these periods, systemic corruption gradually burgeoned. That aside, the hung parliament could also give a way to foreign interference in our internal affairs. It is of no secret that China, in the past few years, has openly gone to length in facilitating communist coalition, while the US and India also want a friendly Kathmandu administration. Now that the parliament is hung, foreign actors could intensify their efforts to influence coalition politics and government formation – and in doing so, could further push Nepal towards political instability.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">Controversial Provisions of the Election Commission</h2>\r\nThe Election Commission (EC) in its code of conduct <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/candidature-to-be-canceled-if-mass-rallies-is-carried-out-before-november-\">banned</a> organizing rallies, corner meetings or seminars before November 3- and <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/candidature-to-be-canceled-if-mass-rallies-is-carried-out-before-november-\">allowed</a> door-to-door campaigns only in groups not exceeding 25 people. In previous elections, mass gatherings, rallies and seminars were common practices but owing to the newly introduced rules, candidates relied heavily on door-to-door campaigning. Further, the Election Commission also prohibited use, sale or distribution of symbolic materials with logos on caps, t-shirts, bags among other items. This further led candidates to rely heavily on social media. Social media campaigning has been effective in recent polls due to wide availability of smart phones and internet - and also because candidates can reach a wider audience with <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/11/09/kp-oli-boosts-uml-s-digital-campaigning\">minimal cost</a>. However, some candidates relied so heavily on online campaigning that they ended up <a href=\"https://www.himalkhabar.com/news/132963\">spending</a> quite a lot. The Election Commission had introduced new provisions to reduce spendings of candidates - but the EC’s moves aren’t strictly in line with democratic spirit. Democratic elections aren’t just for selecting representatives through procedural participation of constituencies but elections also equally serve as a medium to engage the general public in political, ideological and policy discourses. Thus, restricting election campaigns could have unintended consequences. Lack of enthusiasm among constituencies this time round, as reflected in the low voter turnout, could also have to do with the newly introduced provisions.<br />\r\n&nbsp;', NULL, 2768, NULL, NULL, 'Sourav Dahal', '/uploads/banner_image/1672899141_Nepalese_Constituent_Assembly_Building.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-11', '2022-11-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01-05 16:57:21', '2023-01-05 16:57:36'),

As of now, Nepali Congress-led alliance is set to <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2022/12/03/congress-led-coalition-set-to-form-government-in-bagmati\">form</a> a government in Bagmati Province. It is reported that JSP, LSP and Janamat Party could <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/janamat-party-and-lsp-ready-to-form-alliance-for-coalition-government/\">collaborate</a> with the current ruling alliance to form a government in Madhesh Province. Similarly, the opposition alliance led by CPN UML is also on the run for coalition in Province 1, however, the Janata Samajwadi Party’s dramatic turn to withdraw from CPN UML-led alliance have <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-1/2022/12/06/government-formation-in-province-1-gets-complex-as-jsp-leaves-\">reduced</a> prospects of the CPN UML- led government. The Nepali Congress-led alliance is mostly likely to form a <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/11/28/nepali-congress-led-alliance-likely-to-form-governments-in-all-seven-\">coalition government</a> in the remaining provinces as well. This is because the coalition for the federal government will determine the coalition at the provincial levels, and now that the ruling alliance has agreed to continue with the current coalition at the centre, the ruling alliance is also expected to form governments in all seven provinces. However, since all seven provinces now have hung parliament, there might be instability in the government.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Anti-incumbency Wave</h3>\r\n&nbsp;The surprise victory of independent candidates in the local polls held last May gave a way to a slew of independent candidacies for the provincial polls. As many as 1094 independent candidates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://election.ekantipur.com/party/10?lng=nep\">forayed</a> into the election, and 12 managed to pull off victories. Although this number isn’t high, the percentage of votes received by independent candidates is quite promising.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 align=\"left\">Provincial Polls Overshadowed</h2>\r\nBoth provincial and federal polls were conducted in a single phase on 20th November, 2022. However, most of the voters were not even aware about the candidates for provincial elections. Many didn’t even know sub-constituencies - let alone candidates. This has to do with a couple of factors. First and foremost, since the election was carried out in a single phase, which is justified when seen from the financial point of view, federal polls grabbed all the attention of media, politicos and general public alike. The political parties largely focused on federal elections, and federal candidates while neglecting federal polls. The EC too <a href=\"https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/18449\">failed</a> to make voters aware about the provincial elections and lack of a user-friendly database for election and candidates added to it. However, when seen from the point of effective federal practice, the single phase election has its own downsides. Even more so when the federal system hasn’t been fully institutionalized and the proper coordination between three tiers of government is still lacking.', NULL, 2807, NULL, NULL, 'Rasila Dhamala', '/uploads/banner_image/1672899904_Nepal-Elections-NT.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-11', '2022-11-15', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01-05 17:10:05', '2023-01-05 17:32:03');

The security officials had &nbsp;to fire 69 rounds of <a href=\"https://www.annapurnapost.com/news/election-nepal-23-217780\">air fire</a> in polling stations to control the dispute between the party representatives.

Unfortunately, the dispute led to the death of a person, aged 24 &nbsp;in Bajura. Not only that, the Cadres of the Nepali congress and CPN-UML caused <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/bajura-voting-clash.html\">chaos</a> in the voting center, i.e. Triveni municipality-7 in Bajura. The security personnels had to use force. Also, &nbsp;during the campaigning for the party’s candidate for federal elections, CPN-UML’s Gandaki province secretariat member Hari Kafle got <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/11/15/growing-acts-of-violence-add-to-security-challenges-for-next-week-s-\">injured</a> to the point where he had to get seven stitches in his head.

The Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizens, Ms. Uma Regmi represented Nepal. Overall, the Conference of the Parties focused on emphasizing on the critical importance of empowering all stakeholders to engage in five- year climate action for more inclusiveness. It ended with a breakthrough agreement to provide the funding for all the loss and damages incurred by the climate disasters, an issue added and adopted for the first time. This was the majority of countries\' concern including Nepal as the country alerted on the issue of sensitive geography and the effects on ecosystems in the Himalayan areas. Nepal also pointed out on the gap in financing to cover up the losses caused by Climate Change induced disasters to the delegates<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMoreover, the countries that participated came to the conclusion that they would stay committed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees celsius, and cut greenhouse gas emissions for better adaptation. In addition, new funding arrangements including dedicated funds to assist developing nations were imposed. Transitional committee is to be established and expected to be operationalized by the end of March 2023 in order to provide recommendations on ways to operationalize funding.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOn the other hand, new pledges of more than USD 230 million were made to the Adaptation fund which will help the vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change through concrete adaptation solutions. Moreover, the Sharm el- Sheikh implementation plan highlights that a global low carbon economy transformation will require at least 4-6 trillion USD a year. There were also few concerns that the developed countries’ goal to mobilize USD 100 billion per year by 2020 were not met.

The persuasion of military diplomacy emerged to represent the state\'s national interest. Military diplomacy\'s activities entail gathering security and armed related information of the countries, forming strategic cooperation that suits both, thus, military diplomacy is an essential tool of the state to facilitate its foreign policy aims and objectives. In the country context, Nepal maintains military relations with many countries around the globe. Nepal’s military relations and cooperation have enormously augmented for the past decades.&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>Military Engagements in the history</strong></h2>\r\nThe history of military diplomacy is observed since the time of Nepal’s unification by King Prithvi Narayan Shah. His strategy was defending the nation’s territory from annexation. During Rana period, their strategy was to become Britishers ally to save the country from being colonized. Jung Bahadur Rana assisted Britishers&nbsp;during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Indian-Mutiny\">Indian Mutiny</a>&nbsp;of 1857–58. He sent a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contingent\">contingent</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gurkha-people\">Gurkha</a>&nbsp;soldiers to the British, establishing a tradition of Gurkha&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/armed-force\">military service</a>&nbsp;in the British army. Furthermore, he was able to bring back four districts of Nepal through negotiation with the Britishers.\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFurther, King Mahendra initiated Nepal to become a member of United Nations. Relation with China and USSR was established and Nepal adopted non-aligned foreign policy.&nbsp;During the period of Maoist insurgency<strong>, </strong>military aid mostly came from India, US, and the UK. However, Chinese assistance during the insurgency period began and gradually increased. During 2001 – 2004, US granted 29 million as military aid, seeing Maoist as a threat to its part of global “war on terror”. The UN and European nations condemned supporting sides viewing this as a form of human rights violation.&nbsp;In the transition period after signing Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA), Nepal’s internal priority was focused on disarmament and being obliged towards the provisions of CPA. In this period, the Nepal Army lobbied with the government to discontinue the operations of UNMIN (United Nations Mission in Nepal) which was entrusted to support the peace process in Nepal. As Nepal army was dissatisfied with the monitoring of the arms of army and Maoist. In 2011, Madhav Kumar Nepal sent a letter to the UN forcing the UNMIN to exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\n<strong>Nepal’s Military Relations</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u>Nepal Army’s relation with India:</u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal and India established its military cooperation in 1947 after India gained independence from Britishers. The tripartite agreement states that six regiment would transfer to the Indian Army. Until now, 32,000 Gurkha soldiers are serving in the Indian Army. In order to ease the process of retirement services provided by the Indian Army, the military pension branch was set up in Kathmandu, two pension paying offices and 22 district soldiers boards, this is regulated by the Indian Embassy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAside this, Indian and Nepalese Army have a special bond of exchanging special relation due to cultural and linguistic similarities. Nepal and India exchange honorary ranks exchanged with each other’s chief of army staff, military exchanges, military visits, India’s humanitarian assistance in times of crisis for e.g., during the earthquake and COVID-19 India was the first country to help Nepal.&nbsp;Nepal has been buying weapons from India under the 1950 Peace and Friendship. Until 2004 India supplied weapon to Nepal to combat Maoists. After King Gyanendra’s decision to restrict civil liberties and democratic rights, India put hold on its supply of lethal and non-lethal weapons to Nepal government in 2005. In 2013, Nepal Army initially decided to purchase and import 11.132 million cartridges and bullets, 24,166 weapons of various kinds and 81- and 51-mm mortars from India. In 2022 India broke the Chinese monopoly and 8-year-old Chinese cartel in Nepal, an Indian private company has supplied 2 million of the 5.56x45mm rounds for the Nepalese army’s assault rifles under a government-to-government contract route.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<u><strong>Nepal Army’s relation with China:</strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal and China’s military relations can be traced back to formalization of their relations in 1955. In the case of defense cooperation, Nepal sought weapons from China in 1988. Despite ideological differences China consistently provided non-lethal equipment to the Nepal government during the insurgency period. China has supported APF who looks after the border points. Chinese government has supported to build APF training academy. China also showed interest to build National Defense Academy of Nepal Army. Similarly, Chinese announced 2.53 billion rupees grant to Nepal Army to buy better equipment for peace keeping missions. Chinese have provided digital radio trunking systems to enhance communications. In addition to this, Nepal and China began its joint military exercise Sagarmatha Friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<u><strong>Nepal Army’s relation with US:</strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe US cooperates with Nepal in defense cooperation and <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-nepal/\">humanitarian assistance</a>. As Nepal was going through insurgency, Colin Powell paid a visit to Nepal and discussed the possibilities of sending hardware from the U.S to fight against the terror. Initially, the US presence in Nepal was mainly concerned with humanitarian assistance in health, social and economic development. In the case of Arms and ammunition; the Nepal Army acquired the M16 rifles for the first time in 2003 as part of the US government’s support to contain Maoist revolutionaries. Washington provided around 17,000 sophisticated rifles as per the deal with the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in 2002. In 2019, Nepal acquired M4, M-16, and A4 rifles from the US to equip its squad deployed in war-torn countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the recent time, controversies surfaced on Nepal’s application to the United States’ State Partnership Programme. The Nepal Army sent official letter to apply for SPP to the US embassy in 2015 and again in 2017. There was no official letter that was signed between two governments. The controversary surfaces when General Flynn visited Nepal to learn the status of SPP. The concern was raised regarding SPP quoting it was a part of IPS.&nbsp;In response, the document was leaked in the media where Nepal Army had sent an official request to the embassy during the tenure of former COAS Rajendra Chettri. Another proposed 10 points draft agreement was leaked in the media which US claimed it to be fake. Finally, Nepal Government decided not to be a part of SPP. The controversary raises concerns on the credibility of Nepal Army and lack of coordination among the state institutions.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The Role of Nepal Army in Military Diplomacy</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u><strong>Defense Attach</strong>é :</u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe defense attaché serves in the embassy as a representation of its country.&nbsp; [24] Initially the culture of sending military officers began with French in 1806 which was followed by other European countries. In Nepal\'s context presently there are six defense attaches representing the US, UK, India, China, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The military attache’s role also includes being able to gain insights of the country they are sent in a diplomatic mission. It includes, understanding the culture, perspective of the public and forming a strategic picture of how the attache can benefit from the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<u><strong>UN Peacekeeping Mission:</strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal’s first UN mission was in Lebanon in 1958, Nepal was the only country from South Asia that was selected for the mission. Nepal has been to 44 missions as an observer and peacekeeping troops until 2019<strong>. </strong>The mission does not only benefit economically or diplomatically but the officials gain professional experience after the mission. Nepal Army’s Welfare Fund increases through the levy deducted from the Nepali peacekeepers and reimbursement from the United Nations. It has now reached tentatively around 50 billion NPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<u><strong>Joint Military Training:</strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal Army conducts joint military training as a part showcasing its soft power. Joint Military training is mostly related to familiarize both armies with each other’s weapons, equipment, tactics, techniques and procedures of operating in a counter-insurgency environment in mountainous terrain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Nepal, high altitude and mountain warfare course started from 1990-2018, the countries that have participated are Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, England, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Sweden, US, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, Lebanon, Maldives. The total number of trainees: have reached 287. The most frequent joint military exercises are with India (Surya Kiran), trainings on jungle warfare and high-altitude warfare.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal Army have played important role in promoting country’s interest and maintained balanced relationship among countries that it has bilateral ties. In the later period, Nepal’s military, Nepal police and paramilitary force have been primarily supported by China, India and the U.S. The U.S wants to expand its influence with its Indo-Pacific strategy by engaging states through its instruments like MCC, SPP of the US and while China is expanding its presence through BRI. India is also trying to accommodate Nepal into BIMSTEC. Nepal should be cautious to promote its security interest and protect from being dragged into any military alliances. The lack of coordination is seen among the institution especially the line ministries and Nepal Army which automatically affects the preparedness of the country for the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal most expand military cooperation with countries with similar interests and in the areas where it can benefit the most. The reputation that Nepal has earned through its long-standing contribution in peace keeping force opens up avenue to promote Nepal’s soft diplomacy. Similarly, the role of Defense Attache plays important role to strengthen Nepal’s military diplomacy. The roles of DAs must be strengthened to facilitate the same.<br />\r\nThe Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs should equally play role to foster benefits through military and defense diplomacy. Lack of coordination and communications among institutions have led to controversies as evident in SPP debate in Nepal. To avoid such situation, line ministries and Nepal Army must come together and form a consensus while dealing related matters.</p>', NULL, 2674, NULL, NULL, 'Prakriti Shree Adhikary', '/uploads/banner_image/1672998524_policy brief - Mil.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01', '2023-01-06', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01-06 20:24:28', '2023-01-15 17:58:06'),

The BRI, in general, entails five main components – i) connectivity routes, ii) unimpeded trade, iii) financial integration, iv) policy coordination and v) people-to- people connectivity. The infrastructure projects span some one hundred and forty countries, mostly in Asia and Europe, as well as Oceania and East Africa. BRI is two-pronged; meaning it contains aspects of both land and the sea. The overland <em>Silk Road Economic Belt </em>proposes routes for road and rail transportation passing through landlocked Central Asia along the historical trade routes of the Western regions with an aim to revitalize a series of ancient overland trading routes connecting Europe and Asia. The <em>21<sup>st</sup> Century Maritime Silk Road </em>moves along the Indo-Pacific Sea routes through Southeast Asia to South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. More than 146 countries and 32 international organizations have signed cooperation agreements for the BRI as of March 2022. It is estimated that the BRI expenses could be around $1.2-1.3 trillion by 2027; and is slated to be completed by 2049.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal entered into BRI on May 12, 2017, when then Foreign Secretary Mr. Shanker Das Bairagi, present Chief Secretary of the Government of Nepal and the then Chinese ambassador to Nepal&nbsp;H.E. Yu Hong signed the Memorandum of Agreement. In 2018, Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli presented a list of 35 projects to be conducted under the BRI, to his Chinese counterpart Prime Minister of China Mr Li Keqiang. After the Chinese side repeatedly insisted to reduce the number of projects to a single digit, nine projects were subsequently proposed. The proposed projects are –\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:upper-roman;\">\r\n	<li>Upgradation of Rasuwagadhi-Kathmandu Road,</li>\r\n	<li>Kimathanka-Hile Road Construction,</li>\r\n	<li>Road joining Dipayal to China’s border,</li>\r\n	<li>Tokha-Bidur Road,</li>\r\n	<li>Galchii-Rasuwagadhi-Kerung 400kv Transmission line,</li>\r\n	<li>Keyrung-Kathmandu Rail (feasibility study),</li>\r\n	<li>Tamor Hydroelectricity Project (762 MW),</li>\r\n	<li>Phulkot Karnali Hydroelectricity Project (762 MW) and</li>\r\n	<li>Madan Bhandari Science and Technology University</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBesides connectivity and infrastructure projects, the MoU includes provisions for free trade, policy exchange, use of Chinese currency, people-people connectivity among others. Five years have passed since the signing of the agreement, and yet not a single project has materialized, nor any provisions implemented.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Context: A Brief Overview of Heightened Chinese Engagements</h2>\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWith the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal 2015, dissatisfaction soared in the Madhes region resulting in the third Madhes Uprising – and then subsequently in the imposition of the unofficial blockade in the southern border points of Nepal. Trade with India was disrupted causing shortage of petrol and other essential products. The situation was so precarious that Nepal had no other options than to start importing essential products from China. This led to the watershed moment in Nepal’s international trade when Nepal signed an oil trade deal with China on 28 October 2015, expecting to end decades-long monopoly of the Indian Oil Corporation in the Nepali market. The need for trade diversification pushed Nepal to further open up trade and connectivity links through the northern frontier. Nepal signed the Transit and Transport Agreement (TTA) with China in 2016. Meanwhile, China had also been pushing Nepal to sign up for the BRI which finally happened in 2017.<br />\r\nThen, Beijing’s proclivities to enhance its influence over Kathmandu through its ties with the communist parties of Nepal started to emerge. In 2017, China facilitated the communist coalition for the federal and provincial polls. After the polls, a unified communist party named as Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was formed. So long as the NCP remained in power, Chinese influence and interference over Nepal’s internal affairs continued to burgeon. For instances, in 2019, about fifty Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders trained more than two hundred NCP leaders on “Xi Jinping’s Thoughts”. In 2020, Nepal voted for Beijing’s new security law for Hong Kong, introduced amidst the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests with provisions of harsh penalties for vaguely defined political crimes, at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Similarly, in 2020 itself, Nepal defended Chinese policies in the western region of Xinjiang, where Uyghurs Muslim community was subjected to <a href=\"putz,%20catherine.%209th%20october,%202020.%20which%20countries%20are%20for%20or%20against%20china’s%20xinjiang%20policies?%20.%20the%20diplomat.%20(21st%20december,%202022).%20https://thediplomat.com/2020/10/2020-edition-which-countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang-policies/\">atrocities </a>by the state, at the UN General Assembly. In December 2020, Chinese vice minister Guo Yenzhou visited Nepal in an attempt to avert the split of the NCP. China’s ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi also stepped up engagements with the NCP leaders for the same<sup>12</sup> – but to no avail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn March 2021, the NCP was dissolved by the Supreme Court of Nepal, and this led to the split of the NCP into three different communist parties - CPN UML, CPN Maoist Center and CPN Unified Socialist. With this, the Nepali Congress-led alliance took over the Kathmandu administration. Then, Beijing lobbied against the parliamentary ratification of the US’s</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<div>Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact, labeling it as a “<a href=\"giri,%20anil.%2024th%20february,%202022.%20why%20a%20deadline%20if%20it’s%20a%20‘gift’?%20china%20taunts%20at%20us%20over%20mcc.%20kathmandu.%20the%20kathmandu%20post.%20(21st%20december,%202022).%20https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/02/24/why-a-deadline-if-it-s-a-gift-china-taunts-at-us-%20over-mcc\">pandora’s box</a>”. To China’s dismay, the compact was ratified by the parliament in February 2022. For Beijing, these developments were signs that its influence over Kathmandu was gradually slipping away.&nbsp;China then stepped-up its high-level engagements. Within a span of a few months, there were three high level visits from Beijing to Kathmandu. China’s Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi visited Kathmandu in March, CCP’s International Liaison Department Head Liu Zianchao in July and Chinese Speake Li Zhanshu visited in September 2022. In these visits, China attempted to improve its ties with democratic forces, particularly the Nepali Congress, while still pushing for the communist coalition. The BRI implementation, however, has taken a backseat. Although it was expected that China would sign BRI Implementation Framework Agreement during Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit, that wasn’t to be.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Findings &amp; Analysis</h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>BRI: China’s Global Strategy</strong></h3>\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is the central component of Xi’s “major country diplomacy” which calls for China to “assume a greater leadership role for global affairs in accordance with its rising power and status.” The US-led West has viewed BRI as China’s strategy “under the guise of connectivity”, to extend its sphere of influence starting from its immediate neighborhood to far beyond, Europe and Africa. The US has launched similar initiatives to rival China’s BRI – namely Build Back Better World (B3W), and Indo Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). The relationship between the two is that of the great power rivalry, and the US has approached with Indo-Pacific strategy to contain China – as reflected in building alliances of the likes of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), and AUKUS. This would make it further difficult for Nepal to tread a thin line of balance between these two rival superpowers – if and when Nepal-China BRI agreement were to materialize.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>India’s Position on the BRI</h3>\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIndia has remained firmly opposed to the BRI with claims that the initiative “passes through Indian territory that is illegally held by Pakistan.” However, it is <a href=\"baruah,%20darshana%20m.%2015th%20may,%202017.%20nepal%20joined%20the%20belt%20and%20road.%20what%20does%20that%20mean%20for%20india?.%20the%20diplomat.%20(21st%20december,%202022).%20https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/nepal-joined-the-belt-and-road-what-does-that-mean-for-india/\">evident </a>that India views BRI as China’s strategic initiative and thus has remained opposed to it. While India might have economic interests in joining hands with China; India fears that with BRI, China could bolster its presence and leverage within South Asia, and chip way its sphere of influence. Further, India is concerned about Pakistan\'s ties with China. India’s arch-rival Pakistan is now an all-weather friend, as well as a strategic ally of China. China has been investing heavily in Pakistan under the BRI framework to improve infrastructure within Pakistan and enhance Sino-Pakistan trade ties by modernizing Pakistan’s roads, rails, air and energy transportation system, and by connecting the deep-sea Pakistani ports of Gwadar and Karachi to China’s Xinjiang province and beyond by overland routes. Given the strategic implications of the initiative and India’s opposition to it, Nepal is facing further difficulties in implementing provisions and undertaking projects under the BRI, according to the key informants interviewed for this research.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<h3>BRI in limbo</h3>\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIt has already been more than five years since the MoU of Nepal-China BRI was signed between the two parties but the progress has been negligible - and over the years, BRI implementation seems to have lost its momentum. Unlike five years earlier, implementation of the BRI isn’t at the priority of the government and the Chinese side doesn’t seem eager as well. For much of 2020, and the first half of 2021, BRI implementation couldn’t make any <a href=\"sun,%20luna.%2012th%20march,%202022.%20how%20will%20china’s%20belt%20and%20road%20initiative%20fare%20when%20partners%20russia,%20ukraine%20are%20at%20war?.%20beijing.%20china%20macro%20economy.%20(21st%20december,%202022).%20https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3170142/how-%20will-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-fare-when-partners\">progress </a>as attributed to Covid- 19 pandemic. However, even as the pandemic slowed down, and the world has returned to the semblance of normalcy with high-level diplomatic engagements resuming, no progress has been made so far.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h4><strong><em>Lack of Preparation on Nepal’s Part</em></strong>:</h4>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nNepal’s lack of preparation was seen right from beginning when the MoU was signed without much deliberation over contentious provisions like Free Trade Agreement, Policy Exchange, and use of Chinese currency for trade among others. Nepal’s unpreparedness was further reflected in the selection of projects – while Nepal had initially proposed thirty-five projects, upon China’s repeated insistence Nepal had to reduce the number to nine. And to date, not a single ministry, apart from the Ministry of Industries, Commerce and Supply has carried out any studies pertaining to provisions and projects under the BRI.Further, Nepal hasn’t formed any institutional body dedicated to the BRI implementation. According to our key informants, Nepal lacks institutional mechanisms to undertake a bilateral project of such scales in an efficient manner.Given the scale of the BRI projects, an institutional body headed by top level executives becomes essential to expedite negotiations with China, and also to effectively facilitate coordination between domestic institutions.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h4><strong><em>China’s Slowing BRI Momentum</em></strong>:</h4>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nBeginning in 2018, China began reassessing its investments in foreign countries as it showed signs of a “slowing economy” . China was then wary of not lending frivolously anymore like it did in Sri Lanka and Malaysia where new governments questioned their predecessors’ decision of borrowing from Beijing. In China itself,a public pull back by Chinese officials was witnessed post criticisms regarding projects in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan in relation to their bloated expenses. Of late, it is reported that China has reduced its financial resources allocated for the initiative. China’s dwindling momentum is also reflected in the three high-profile visits from China to Nepal in the year 2022. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Nepal in March, International Liasion Department’s head Liu Zianchao’s in July and China’s speaker Li Zhansu’s in September. As discussed above, BRI wasn’t prioritized much by China in these visits and no substantive agreement pertaining to the BRI was made.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h4><strong><em>Loan Component of the BRI and Fear of perceived “debt trap strategy”: </em></strong></h4>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nAs a Least Developed Country (LDC), Nepal has been enjoying soft and concessional loans. While the average interest rate of Chinese loans globally is 4%, and the average estimated interest rate of China’s loans for BRI-related projects is 4.2% with a grace period of less than two years, and maturity length of less than 10 years, the maximum interest rate of soft loans that multilateral donors such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank provide has an interest rate of around 1.3% and a more extended repayment period. According to the Finance Ministry, the total outstanding debt as a percentage of the GDP for 2021 had crossed 40% while it was just 25.30% in 2015. The debt to GDP ratio of 40% is quite high for a remittance-drive economy, and any increase in this number could pose further financial challenges.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>High-interest rates of the BRI and experiences of some nations like that Sri Lanka have raised doubts if China is guided by debt trap or strategic trap diplomacy. Loans from Chinese banks, which account for around 19.6% of the total foreign debt, have further exacerbated Sri Lanka’s ongoing economic crisis. The failure of the Hambantota Port has been a glaring example of challenges associated with Chinese commercial loans. On December 2017, being unable to pay back loans, Sri Lanka formally handed over the strategic port of Hambantota to China on a 99- year lease. China then approached with the practice of “evergreening” – a practice in which a lender lends more loans to help debtors to pay their prior debts.<sup>32</sup> Sri Lanka had requested to restructure the debts, to which China has rejected, proposing instead to provide a USD 1 Billion as loan, which in turn would be used to pay off old debts to Chinese banks. China had given four more large loans between March 2020 to August 2021 to help keep Sri Lanka solvent. Similarly, in the past decade, Kenya’s and Pakistan’s overall public debts increased by ninefold and more than doubled, respectively – with Chinese loans growing the fastest in both the countries. The case of Sri Lanka and other countries struggling with Chinese loans has raised fears regarding perceived “debt trap diplomacy” amongst Nepal’s political leadership.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf recent, the Nepali Congress-led government made it clear that Nepal does not have the capacity to take commercial loans and would only accept grants; and is also pushing for the BRI projects to be open for international competitive bidding.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h4><strong><em>Challenges of the Kathmandu-Keyrung Railway</em></strong>:</h4>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div><br />\r\nAccording to our KIs, China isn’t as eager about the trans-Himalayan railway due to myriad of challenges associated with its construction. Some even claimed that the railway was reluctantly included in the joint communiqué of the second International Belt and Road Forum held in April 2019 in Beijing, as Nepali leaders persistently pushed for it. This ambitious project was framed by political parties, particularly communist ones, as an economic and geopolitical game-changer for Nepal. In late 2018, a pre-feasibility study of the railway conducted by the Chinese Railway Administration concluded that ‘it was an extremely hard project but not impossible.’ Of late, China has proposed Nepal to sign a letter of exchange in order to carry out a feasibility study. However, it is difficult for two parties to reach a consensus on financing modality for the construction of the project. China is prepared to loan the fund for its construction; however, Nepal insists upon grant.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h4><strong><em>Free Trade Agreement</em></strong><em>: </em></h4>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div><br />\r\nFree Trade Agreement is also one of the provisions specified in the BRI MoU. The Chinese side provided an economic analysis, studying the impact of the FTA between Nepal and China; the said analysis concluded that Nepal will benefit by a 4.8% increase in its GDP if it went ahead with the agreement. Contrarily, Nepal’s report studying the impact of FTA provided a different scenario – a loss of 0.24% in the GDP. Nepal’s analysis was then forwarded to China suggesting to sit for a meeting to discuss it, however, there has been no response from China yet. Due to the uneven trade ratio between Nepal and China, moving ahead with the FTA will be detrimental to Nepal’s economy, as ascertained by our KIIs.</div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h4><em>Policy Exchange:</em></h4>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div><br />\r\nNepal has seen an increase in China’s influence in both political and bureaucratic level in the past few years. The implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative in Nepal may signify China’s further increased presence in Nepal’s internal affairs. With the signing of the MoU of BRI, Nepal also agreed to a provision of Policy Exchange, ‘in areas of major development strategies, plans, and policies.’&nbsp;While addressing his visit to Nepal in October 2019, President Xi Jinping had also reiterated the need to have “more exchanges and experience sharing on governance and development to deliver greater benefits to peoples.” In the past years, China has conducted several affairs in regards to ‘high-level exchanges’ as well as ‘experience sharing on governance’ that can be brought under the light of policy exchange. A prominent one is a two-day symposium on Xi Jinping Thoughts conducted during the Nepal Communist Party administration in 2017. There is considerable ambiguity regarding what carrying out exchanges in areas of major development strategies, plans and policies actually entails. However, the provision as vague as “policy exchange” with China which has authoritarian model of governance carries risk of challenges to our democratic practices, and could give a way to further Chinese interference in our internal affairs.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\nNepal signed up for the BRI in 2017 which was a culmination of China’ push coupled with Nepal’s desire to diversify its trade, after the unofficial blockade of 2015, by opening new connectivity links through its northern frontier. Within Nepal, joining the Chinese initiative was met with welcome remarks from across the spectrum. The BRI managed to evade scrutiny for years, partly as the MoU was kept secret by both the parties for five long years. When the MoU was leaked by a local media portal, and challenges associated with its implementation and provisions began making headlines, the BRI narrative shifted for the worse. China’s BRI momentum itself has slowed down, and the Nepali Congress led government has taken an unequivocal position that the BRI can’t be undertaken further with the same financing modality. Further, China’s supposed debt-trap diplomacy, cases of corruption and irregularities, and its project implementation model have added to the challenges. While there still remains a room to negotiate with China on contentious provisions, and on the implementation model, it is yet to be seen if China would be ready to accommodate Nepal’s demands. If or not, the BRI will undergo further implementation is now contingent on China’s flexibility to address Nepal’s concerns.<br />\r\n&nbsp;', NULL, 2674, NULL, NULL, 'CESIF Nepal', '/uploads/banner_image/1673093381_policy Brief - BRI.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-12', NULL, NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01-07 22:54:41', '2023-01-20 11:59:51'),

This marks the third high-level visit from Beijing within a span of a few months after the parliamentary ratification of the Millenium Challenge Corporation Compact last February. Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councillor Wang Yi <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/03/25/chinese-foreign-minister-wang-arrives-in-kathmandu\">had visited Nepal in March</a>, and Liu Jianchao, the head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, had visited Nepal in July. During the visit, Li met with President Bidhya Devi Bhandari, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, Foreign Minister Agni Prasad Sapkota and other high-level representatives from mainstream political parties of Nepal. The dialogues mainly centred on relevant issues pertaining to Nepal-China relations, with a <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinas-third-ranked-leader-li-zhanshu-holds-talks-with-his-nepali-counterparts-sharma-oli-prachanda/article65886248.ece\">focus on the Belt and Road Initiative Agreement</a> signed between the two in 2017.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://english.khabarhub.com/2022/12/272371/\">A six-point MoU</a> was signed<a href=\"https://nepalnews.com/s/nation/6-point-mou-signed-between-nepal-and-china\"> to continue for 5 years </a>by the Honourable Speaker of the Federal Parliament Agni Prasad Sapkota and&nbsp; Li Changshu, Chairman of the National People\'s Congress Standing Committee of the People\'s Republic of China. In the six point agreement, both parties have agreed to focus on strengthening mutual trust, respect each other\'s independence, sovereignty and integrity and support each other’s core interest.&nbsp; Likewise, both sides will try to increase inter-parliamentary exchange and cooperation at all levels through multilateral means. Similarly, both sides will give priority to high-level visits between Nepal and People’ Republic of China, along with exchanges of contacts between the legislatures of both countries. Both parties will promote parliamentary friendly groups to increase their engagement playing roles in strengthening&nbsp; the mutual relationship.The MoU also focuses on the issues relating to strengthening mutual relations under the framework of regional and global organisations and giving importance to facilitating the mutual benefits by means of enhancing inter-connectivity as per agreements including BRI among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frequent high-level visits from China after the parliamentary ratification of the MCC, rejection of the US State Partnership Program (SPP), and just before the federal and provincial elections set to take place in November, have raised many questions. In the past few years, China has increased its engagement and has shown tendencies to interfere in the internal affairs of Nepal. <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/china-commends-nepal-s-decision-not-to-be-part-of-state-partnership-program/\">China openly commended Nepal’s decision to reject SPP</a>, which China had claimed to be a part of the US’s Indo-Pacific Strategy, and had also <a href=\"https://www.nepalitimes.com/here-now/china-lobbying-against-mcc/\">lobbied against the parliamentary ratification of the MCC pact</a>. Further, Liu Jianchao, during his visit, had urged the <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/07/09/top-level-chinese-visit-piques-curiosity-about-its-purpose\">communist parties of Nepal to come together </a>for the forthcoming polls, reconciling their differences and conflicting interests. Communist Parties in Nepal and CCP share the same ideology, making it easier for China to bolster its influence if and when a communist party runs the Kathmandu administration. <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/09/12/visiting-chinese-speaker-may-have-speculations-of-left-unity-to-shrug-off\">China was making efforts to push for the communist coalition in Nepal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time around, significant dialogues were also held on issues surrounding the Belt Road Initiative (BRI), the interconnectivity with Nepal, and the trade prospects. <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/12/c_136276949.htm\">BRI was introduced back in 2013 by China, and Nepal signed an MOU in 2017</a>. As both the countries have shown less push in implementing the BRI agreement and the infrastructural projects under the initiative have been in limbo for quite a while now. This time, views were exchanged regarding the importance of the implementation of the BRI agreement, however, whether or not the agreement gets implemented is yet to be seen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike MCC, BRI has loan components, which might pose economic risks for Nepal. China, in recent times,<a href=\"https://english.khabarhub.com/2022/29/265280/\"> has been heavily blamed for the \"debt-trap diplomacy\" </a>as it has been providing developing countries with commercial loans, and in some cases, those countries have failed to pay China in time. Those countries then are made to offer significant concessions to China which has induced skepticisms regarding financial benefits of projects undertaken with Chinese loans. Especially with <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2022/08/is-china-to-blame-for-sri-lankas-debt-woes/\">the ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka, China has been accused harshly for laying this trap, </a>and as a result, this has led to reduced interest of developing countries in accepting Chinese projects. Thus, the current Deuba administration and some political parties have had apprehensions regarding the financial aspect of the BRI projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On t he other side, immediately after Li’s visit, <a href=\"https://nepalnews.com/s/nation/china-to-reopen-2-border-points-for-trade-in-nepal-li-zhanshu\">China partially opened border points, particularly in Rasuwagadhi, </a>and let the containers stuck at the borders for months. China had <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/when-will-the-undeclared-chinese-blockade-end/\">unilaterally imposed a soft embargo</a> on Nepal-China border points under the pretext of Covid-19 pandemic which remained for years. This move to resolve border issues during the high-profile visit could be read as China’s signal of its readiness to solve the unilaterally-imposed border issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the fact that the federal and provincial polls are nearby, perhaps, this visit could have been waited for a few months. A high-profile visit from a neighbour-superpower at the eve of elections doesn’t carry good diplomatic signals. Despite having a good relationship with China, the rapid change in the nature of Chinese engagements has induced many challenges to Nepal - both in the domestic and diplomatic fronts. Although China’s attempt to push for the communist electoral coalition has failed, it is only likely that China will try to influence Nepal’s internal dynamic even after the November election. Nepal has already been made as a boxing ring in the geopolitical competition among the superpowers. And these types of Chinese approaches might further drag Nepal into the geopolitical tensions in future.&nbsp;</p>', NULL, 2801, NULL, NULL, 'Rasila Dhamala', '/uploads/banner_image/1673254441_Li-Zhanshu.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-10', '2022-10-21', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01-09 19:39:01', '2023-01-11 16:13:18'),

Nepal Army has had a long-standing history of cooperation with security agencies of various nations in areas of capacity development and mutual cooperation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilitary diplomacy in Nepal is found to have been enhanced over the years, as seen during the ‘unofficial’ blockade days, wherein Nepal Army played a key role not just in minimizing the impact of blockade but also for the negotiation. However, in the past year, Nepal Army has been the pivot in controversies of varied sorts, with NA being dragged even to the parliamentary discourses. These controversies surrounding the Nepal Army, and other challenges pertaining to military diplomacy have brought forth a need to carry out further discussions. With the motive to initiate a wider engagement of stakeholders to discuss the relationship between Nepal’s military diplomacy and heightening geopolitical tension in Nepal as well as to share CESIF’s research findings, Centre for Social Inclusion and Federalism (CESIF) organized a seminar on ‘Geopolitics and Role of Military Diplomacy’ on 29 December, 2022 at Aloft Hotel, Kathmandu, Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe session brought together distinguished panelists, Dr. Minendra Rijal (Former Minister of Defence), Lt. Gen. Bala Nanda Sharma (Nepal Army), Lt. Gen. Pawan Bahadur Pande (Nepal Army), and Maj. Gen. Purna Silwal (Nepal Army). The objective of the program was to look into expansion in the practices of military diplomacy from past to most recent and also in light of the current geopolitical condition. It also strived to hold a public discussion in the program where experts, former army officials, scholars, researchers and journalists discussed security issues and role of Nepal Army. Through a public discussion the program aimed to accumulate opinion and suggestion to develop policy recommendations for the Government of Nepal, the Nepal Army, and other government officials.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/ckfinder/userfiles/images/1673279841047_1673325073.jpg\" style=\"width: 2592px; height: 979px;\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Seminar formally began with the welcoming remarks given by CESIF’s Executive Chairperson, Ambassador Vijay Kant Karna. He described how the session will be focusing on the critical issues regarding Military Diplomacy, Nepal Army’s relation with China, India, USA and other countries through various components. followed by this he mentioned the contribution of Nepal Army in the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations to reflect Nepal’s diplomacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter his remarks, CESIF\'s Research Fellow Prakriti Shree Adhikary presented the key findings from the research that highlighted Nepal Army’s role in military diplomacy where she provided the timeline from the past to the most recent contribution made by Nepal Army to practice military diplomacy. She mentioned the engagements of Nepal Army in UNPKO, Joint Military Training, Weapon dealing, bilateral relations with countries like India, China and the US and the U.K and, sending Defense Attache to various countries. Furthermore, she also brought the pressing issues of geopolitical competition in Nepal between India, China and the US.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe presentation also included controversy surrounding SPP and how the government of Nepal failed to provide clear information and dragged Nepal Army and the US unnecessarily. In addition to this, she also mentioned the credibility of Nepal Army for initially denying its role in SPP and later, releasing a public statement accepting it did apply for the SPP. At last, she focused on gaps and challenges in practicing military diplomacy to reflect soft power of the country, coordination among the government institutions and Nepal Army etc. Upon the completion of the presentation, the session proceeded with the panel discussion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis proceedings report aims to summarize the key issues raised in the seminar.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Military Diplomacy as a tool to enhance national interest and interrelationship between Nepal Army and Government Bodies</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMaj. Gen. Purna Silwal reflected upon how the global powers today are coming together to protect their national interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal Army, as one of the major tools of the Nepali government, plays a great role in protecting Nepal’s national interest and its future. Nepal Army has played an important role in undesirable events such as floods, insurgencies, earthquake for rescue and relief missions. Nonetheless, it still requires better coordination amongst government institutions and Nepal Army, in order to tackle negative incidents smoothly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdding to that, Lt. Gen. Pawan Bahadur Pandey said that, “Nepal Army maintains a cordial relation with the Ministry of Defense as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, at times the lack of coordination has been an issue.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLt. Gen. Bala Nanda Sharma reflected upon his experience as a Military Attache from 1989 to 1992, when he was puzzled to learn that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were unable to provide him the required diplomatic assignments and tasks. “The institutions back then were not developed regarding military diplomacy and the assignments that entailed. However, even we were not well acknowledged regarding it.” Incidents like such reflected on how lightly military diplomacy was taken back then. Additionally, he submitted one report per month during his tenure, but later discovered that the officials never examined them. This demonstrates how poorly the institutions coordinated which provided Nepal with little knowledge on military ties with other nations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nErstwhile Minister of Defense, Dr. Minendra Rijal also shined the light on how important it is to bring back expertise and knowledge acquired from abroad during the peacekeeping missions. Nepal will continue to be prone to disasters and the role of Nepal Army in combating them will be forever paramount as will be the role of military diplomacy in preserving Nepal’s national interest. Thus, the government should also take Nepal Army parallelly with its priorities rather than delving into unwanted polarities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Role of Military Diplomacy in Enhancing Bilateral Relationships</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nLt. Gen. Pawan Bahadur Pandey conveyed how smaller countries are better than larger countries as the former are more tactful to get their point across. He stressed on how crucial joint military exercises, attachments, and bilateral meetings between nations are because they are structured in a way that is not entirely a military component as the joint secretary leads it. He added, “While we have a cordial relation with the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I’m unsure if Military Diplomacy is well understood by them. As often, a lot of activities and decisions are conducted in isolation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Lt. Gen. Bala Nanda Sharma, it has been difficult for Nepal to maintain a fine balance between its neighbors - two significant economic and military giants. In that context, the importance of military diplomacy has been high.Lt. Gen. Sharma emphasized that in order for the military to maintain the balance, it is first essential to be aware of Nepal\'s geopolitical strategies. He then stated, “the real situation of omnipresence in the world is seriously challenged. How will China’s BRI be negotiated further when we keep changing our positions everytime we change government?”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLikewise, Maj. Gen. Purna Silwal reflected back on Nepal’s history - how in ancient times, King Prithvi Narayan Shah exercised Military Diplomacy to balance the relations with neighboring countries. He then said, “even in modern times, military aid, military hardware, technology, training, and military alliances were considered to be helpful for bilateral relationships.” Also, in the blockade of 2015, the former Chief of Army Staff (CoAS), Rajendra Chhetri played an important role in removing the blockade within days. He affirmed, “Is it a coincidence or not is up to the imagination.”<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Failure to Acknowledge Military Diplomacy as a means for conducting foreign policy</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMaj. Gen. Purna Silwal (Retd) stressed on how there is a hesitation to recognize Military diplomacy as a tool to safeguard our national interest and that only economic diplomacy is prioritized thus far. “Military Diplomacy’s role is extensive, especially in the context of today’s difficult geopolitical dimensions,” he added. Likewise, Lt. Gen. Bala Nanda Sharma shared his experience as an erstwhile USSR now Russia attache. He said, “In my experience as an Attache, I was rather doing tasks that I was not assigned to be doing because the institutions guiding us were not developed enough. I remember, when I was reporting to the Ambassador, he did not even acknowledge my salute.” He then stressed on how words matter in the diplomatic activities; he questioned whether or not we have produced enough diplomats of international standards and the lack of preparedness in undertaking assignments. He reflected back to the blockade by India in 1989 when Nepal itself was unclear about its stance. The 160 embassies were flooded with information and disinformation as presented by the southern neighbor. Even defense attaches stationed in foreign countries were in a dilemma - this reflected poorly on our country’s attitude.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Nepal and its role in UN Peacekeeping</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMaj. Gen Purna Silwal dated back to the time when Nepal got elected to the UN Peacekeeping and has been in the top five ever since. It has been a great platform for Nepal to represent itself as well as to offer possible opportunities of collaboration. As the peacekeepers are deployed in areas where Nepal has no embassies, they can be mobilized in many bilateral and multilateral roles. Thereby, opportunities as such can be used to promote one’s national interest in the international arena.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFormer Minister for Defense and Nepali Congress leader, Dr. Minendra Rijal stated that the Nepal Army has contributed a lot in peacekeeping through UN Peacekeeping Missions, and it should also use those platforms to further national interests. He maintained, ‘The peacekeeping through military diplomacy itself, we can make our presence felt throughout the globe. And that we can bring home the expertise and knowledge we learn internationally.’ He commended the role played by the Nepal Army in rescue and relief operations during varied calamities, insurgencies and emergencies. The audience on how we are in a period where powerful countries are coming closer to confront amongst themselves to protect their interest. Nepal Army as one of its tools of government can play a great role to protect the future in undesirable incidents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal Army in various events such as Maoist Insurgency, Floods, Earthquake, played a huge role in disaster rescue, relief and response. However, it severely requires better coordination and cooperation on how we can move forward to tackle negative incidents and together achieve national interest.', NULL, 3076, NULL, NULL, 'Prakriti Shree Adhikary', '/uploads/banner_image/1673325360_mil-proceedings.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01', NULL, NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01-10 15:21:00', '2023-01-10 22:06:07');

In South Asian region, five countries have already joined the Chinese initiative, while it has faced opposition from India right from the beginning. China claims that the BRI is aimed at building infrastructure network connecting Asia with other parts of the world along the overland Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. In general, BRI has five major components – i) connectivity routes, ii) unimpeded trade, ii) policy coordination, iv) financial integration and v) people-to-people connectivity. Even though China prefers to portray BRI simply as an initiative which would create a “win-win scenario” to all the participating nations. It is speculated that China has also employed this massive initiative to realize its ulterior strategic motives which has led to new geopolitical ramifications in the region. In case of Nepal, it has been five years since the signing of the MoU, however not a single project has been undertaken, nor any provisions implemented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the motive to initiate a wider engagement of stakeholders to discuss the implications of BRI in the South Asian region and to disseminate the research findings on “Prospects and Challenges of Nepal-China BRI Agreement”, Centre for Social Inclusion and Federalism (CESIF) organized the <strong>International Conference on ‘Geopolitics and BRI in South Asia’</strong> on 23rd December, 2022 at The Everest Hotel, Kathmandu, Nepal. The conference brought together ex-ministers, analysts, academics, diplomats, bureaucrats, politicians, government officials, journalists and experts from South Asian Countries to discuss upon the issues surrounding China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), its geopolitical implications, the fear of perceived “debt-trap diplomacy” of China and other country-specific concerns.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe seminar began with Ambassador Vijay Kant Karna addressing the distinguished guests and providing welcome remarks. “Although labelled as an initiative by China, BRI is a global strategic tool. With connectivity links and infrastructure projects spanning as many as one hundred and forty countries, China has aimed to create an alternative economic system with self at the center. This could ultimately pose a challenge to the US-led liberal world order,” said Amb. Karna. Discussing upon varied interest of regional and global actors, he further added that, “the cause of concern isn’t that global and regional actors are seeking to advance their own interest in Nepal. In fact, that’s what all states do. The concern, however, is that, if Nepal will be able find the delicate geopolitical balance while still prioritizing its national interests.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe seminar then proceeded with presentation by Ms. Prashanti Poudyal, and by Mr. Sourav Dahal, Research Fellows at CESIF on “Prospects and Challenges of Nepal China BRI Agreement”. The researchers succinctly summarized the findings of research with a focus on political, geopolitical implications of the BRI, contentious provisions included in the MoU – particularly Free Trade Agreement and policy exchange, and explained why the BRI in Nepal has been in limbo for the past five years. They reflected on BRI being China’s global strategy in the ‘guise of connectivity’ to expand its sphere of influence starting from its immediate neighborhood to far beyond. And that the US-Led West saw BRI as a threat to its liberal world order. Since both the US and India have remained firmly opposed to the BRI, its implementation could cause further difficulties for Nepal to tread the thin line of geopolitical balance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNotwithstanding, Nepal has not been able to implement the BRI projects and provisions; experts interviewed for CESIF’s research specified varied reasons. Firstly, the lack of preparedness on Nepal’s part, which was seen right from the beginning of signing contentious provisions like the Free Trade Agreement and Policy Exchange in the MoU, to the selection of projects. Secondly, BRI has seen a loss in momentum in the global arena especially in the past few years. Third, Nepal has been especially wary regarding China’s perceived debt trap strategy, which further cautioned Nepali politicians to take a firm stance that BRI projects could not be undertaken with the present financial modality. Political leaders also became cautious to deal with Chinese counterparts after experiences in Pokhara International Airport, Budhi Gandaki Hydropower Project and the infamous Hambantota port fiasco.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding the Free Trade Agreement, CESIF’s research maintains that FTA would be detrimental to Nepal’s economy due to its already uneven trade ratio with China. Furthermore, as obligated by the WTO, China is already providing 98% of its tariff line for zero-tariff to all LDCs. Nepal however has not been able to utilize that to the fullest, due to various issues like non-tariff barriers among others. Therefore, if Nepal is to move ahead with the FTA with China, there will already be a few spaces with which Nepal can leverage.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1>Panel I: BRI and Nepal-China Relations</h1>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/ckfinder/userfiles/images/BRi-pic_1673330860.JPG\" style=\"width: 1374px; height: 866px;\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first panel on ‘BRI and Nepal-China Relations’ brought together former Minister for Foreign Affairs, and current Member of Parliament, Dr. Prakash Sharan Mahat and Former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Pradeep Gyawali. The session was moderated by Associate Editor at AP1 Television, Ms. Sama Thapa.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe session began with Moderator Thapa shedding light on the lack of a proper discourse regarding Nepal\'s Foreign Policy, especially regarding Nepal-China relations. She posed the question to Dr. Mahat regarding the present context of Nepal-China relationship. Dr. Mahat stressed that the SinoNepal relationship is important, especially in regards to BRI. Dr. Mahat highlighted that Nepal lies in between two emerging global powers: China and India, which is an opportunity and as well as a challenge. Dr. Mahat argued that Nepal-China relations is often compared with that of India’s, however, the dynamic of the two can’t be compared due to the geographical differences. Peopleto-people connection as well as trade between China and India are different, as the presence of the Himalayan barrier limits Nepal’s interaction with China. However, that does not hold true in case of India, wherein the engagement is much higher due to the open border in the south. Former Foreign Minister Mr. Gyawali also acknowledged that the relationship between India and China with Nepal is of much significance in a globalized world of today.\r\n<h2>BRI in Nepal and Discussion Before the Agreement</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nDr. Mahat commenced the discussing by referring to the BRI as China\'s mega project, envisioned with the idea of utilizing their own resources for their development. He inferred that Nepal signed the BRI agreement after numerous discussions and meetings in the political and bureaucratic level, however, the initiative has not moved forward. Former Foreign Minister, Mr. Gyawali agreed, and added that the initiatives like BRI would help landlocked and least developing countries like Nepal catch on the global economic trend, as most LDCs haven’t benefitted from the globalization alone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr. Mahat stressed that the implementation of the BRI in Nepal should be strictly based on CostBenefit Analysis. He added that the projects and provisions under BRI should be negotiated so as to reap maximum benefits. Dr. Mahat emphasized that Nepal needs only accept loans, if at all, only for those projects that would ensure return without burdening the economy. Furthermore, Nepal should push for grants instead of loans. However, if China insists on loan, Nepal should ensure that interest rate is at par with that of other multilateral agencies, including the payback period. Mr. Gyawali reflected that ‘we will benefit more if we look at initiatives like BRI as is, without politicizing upon it. It is also important to not let initiatives like MCC and BRI get dragged into unnecessary controversy.’\r\n<h2>FTA and Trans-Himalayan Railway</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn the MoU signed between Nepal and China for BRI, there is also a provision under Article II: Areas of Cooperation, III. Trade Connectivity, wherein it states to “conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement within 2017 and if viable, will start negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to further open up markets and expand two-way trade, with a view to achieving a win-win outcome.” When moderator Thapa asked about the possibility of Free Trade Agreement with China, Dr. Mahat, being the chief negotiator for the MoU on BRI, revealed that Nepal had been reluctant to sign the FTA provision; however, Nepal only agreed after a clause was included that stated to first conduct that feasibility study on the FTA, and move forward it with only if viable. He strongly asserted that FTA with China is not possible for now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFormer Minister Gyawali agreed that FTA with China would be detrimental to Nepal’s economy. He further stressed that in the present context, FTA with any country would not be feasible as Nepal doesn\'t have the production capacity to export. Speaking upon the Trans-Himalayan Railway, which falls under the BRI, Dr. Mahat highlighted that it would be difficult to predict about its future, as the project\'s feasibility study hadn\'t been carried out. He further added that Nepal needs to first ensure its profitability with China before moving forward with it; while India and China would be the primary beneficiary, Nepal would be the secondary.\r\n<h2>Financial Modality of BRI and the Perceived Debt Trap</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nModerator Thapa recalled the erstwhile Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba claiming that Nepal would only move forward with BRI on grants and not on loans. Dr. Mahat stressed that Nepal couldn\'t accept commercial loans from any country and should rather negotiate for grants; thus, the same applied to BRI projects. He reflected upon Nepal\'s increasing debt and stressed that the blend of grant and preferential loans would be most appropriate. The terms and conditions of loan should be at par with multilateral financial institutions, without harsh conditions such as guaranteed return and sourcing of inputs. Former Minister Gyawali too reiterated that Nepal couldn\'t move forward with commercial loans to undertake BRI infrastructure projects; he claimed that there still remains room for negotiation with China to insist on grants or concessional loans. Highlighting that Nepal and China are yet to decide upon the financial modality of the projects, Mr. Gyawali seemed hopeful. While speaking about the perceived debt trap, Former Minister Gyawali gave the example of South American nations who are also under debt, without any investment under the BRI, implying that BRI can’t always be the sole cause of debt trap.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDr. Mahat underlined upon Nepal\'s weak state institutions to be at fault, stressing the need for stronger institutionalization to deal with loans, grants, and aid. He further added that Nepal needs to do more homework without relying on prejudices; else Nepal will suffer. Geopolitical Tussle in Nepal and its Non-aligned Foreign Policy When discussing the effect of China’s and US’s geopolitical tussle in Nepal by moderator Thapa, Dr. Mahat inferred that Nepal should have a non-aligned foreign policy that should be in accordance with Nepal\'s national interest. Similarly, Former Minister Gyawali admitted the existence of Sino-American rivalry in Nepal, but asked not to view initiatives of these countries, BRI and MCC, through the same lens. These initiatives should be seen from the vantage point of economy centering around Nepal’s national interest.\r\n<h1>Panel II: Geopolitics and BRI in South Asia</h1>\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/ckfinder/userfiles/images/bri-panel2_1673331342.JPG\" style=\"width: 1381px; height: 859px;\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second panel entitled, ‘Geopolitics and BRI in South Asia,’ brought together, Professor Srikanth Kondapalli and Dr. Devendra Kumar from India, Dr. Towfiqul Islam Khan from Bangladesh, Dr. Harim Watson Peiris from Srilanka and Mr. Ajaya Bhadra Khanal from Nepal. The session was moderated by Amb. Vijay Kant Karna.\r\n<h2>Covid- 19 Impacting China’s BRI Projects</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding China’s BRI, Prof. Srikanth Kondapalli spoke about how the mega initiative was disrupted by Covid-19. Due to the Ukrainian conflict, BRI projects have lost momentum in the Eurasian region. While the Eurasian region was one of the major focus of the BRI, crisis in energy and fuel, brought about the Ukrainian conflict, impacted its implementation. The Professor further added that, China may restructure the BRI projects in its summit meeting next year. BRI has been China’s unilateral initiative with bilateral agreements with various countries, this, according to Prof. Kondapalli, is a problem which has limited the BRI’s international legitimacy and acceptance. Had the BRI been pushed as a multilateral initiative, for instance, like Build Back Better World – the US’s response to the BRI, jointly undertaken as a multilateral initiative by all G7 countries, it could garner more acceptance. The failure to do so on China’s part has induced fears and suspicions on China’s intent pertaining to the BRI among its regional and global rivals. The professor, however, expressed that in upcoming meetings, there are chances for the China to be more flexible regarding other controversial conditions of BRI.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding the GSI (Global Security Initiative) and GDI (Global Development Initiative), Professor Kondapalli stated that the concept still remains unclear. He mentioned that it is difficult to understand the agenda behind these initiatives as China has time and again brought new concepts and modified them into something else, for example, it brought the concept of “peaceful rise of China” in 2002 which was later modified into the Peace and Development. He added, ‘Thus, not much can be said about such initiatives yet.’ To conclude, the Professor suggested it is still not clear if initiatives like GSI, and GDI is brought to replace the BRI projects.\r\n<h2>Failure of BRI projects in Bangladesh</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding the implementation of BRI project in Bangladesh, Dr. Towfiqul Islam Khan highlighted two terms: i) time overrun and ii) cost overrun. He said that the reason behind the failure of projects is mostly because the projects can’t be completed in the proposed time and which ultimately increases the cost of the project. He also highlighted that due to the over estimation of the cost, the building of infrastructures becomes expensive in Bangladesh than in any other countries. Dr. Khan mentioned that Bangladesh is a labor surplus, densely populated country with a population density of more than 1200 per square km. With conditions as such, he mentioned that it is challenging to implement BRI project in Bangladesh as it comes with higher chances of labor law violations. He said that the BRI projects are not clear about all its underlying terms and conditions, which causes doubt and confusion. He further added that, the lack of transparency and confusion in terms and conditions don’t just hold true for the projects under BRI, but is also an issue in other projects with various regional neighbors. Hence, Dr. Khan concluded with the statement that the problem with lending countries is that they want to be super power, “but they should not only prioritize the conditions that serves them but should also be considerate of the conditions that serves the recipient countries,” he concluded.\r\n<h2>Economic Crisis in Sri Lanka</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nDr. Harim Watson Peiris shared that the roles played by the political leaders in Sri Lanka was not in interest of general public but rather in the interest of the leaders themselves. Dr. Peiris shared that it was not just the commercial loan component that led to the downfall of the Sri Lankan economy but was the combination of the White Elephant. He also added that the governance system was already corrupted which further exacerbated the matter. Hence, as a result, Sri Lanka’s democratic institutions failed causing the economic collapse. It eventually led to a public outrage which in turn forced the leaders out of their offices. While taking about the transparency in the foreign policy and issues of negotiations between countries, Dr. Peiris shared that China is now becoming an important global lender in the national finances of even democratic South Asian countries. He added that China’s involvement can be seen clearly in the situation of Sri Lanka. But on the other hand, he also mentioned that China is slow to recognize the principle of popular support and public consent as they have never been a part of Chinese system.\r\n<h2>China’s Surprising Interest towards Nepal</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Ajaya Bhadra Khanal expressed that after President Xi Jinping took office, China’s approach to Nepal has significantly changed. He added that the day before President Xi visited Nepal in 2019, he had sent a signed article in Nepali media, known as the blue-print for the Nepal-China relationship. He also added that the blueprint contained four-point idea – i) deepen strategic communication, ii) broaden practical co-operation, iii) expand people to people exchanges and iv) enhance security co-operation. Mr. Khanal questioned the first point on deepening strategic communications and what it may entail. He further added that the blueprint also talked about the need to maintain high level exchanges and political mutual support on issues concerning each other’s core interest. He predicted that Nepal may have more exchanges on governance and development as that is the major point that comes up repeatedly during the statements by Chinese leaders including Chinese Ambassadors to Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Khanal, also spoke about China seeking to become the preeminent power not only in Asia but also in the world. He mentioned about Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councillor Wang Yi’s visit to Nepal that emphasized upon three things: i) China will make concerted efforts with Nepal to find a suitable model of governance conducive to Nepal’s stability and economic growth, ii) China supports Nepal in pursuing independent domestic and foreign policy, and iii) China supports in furthering Nepal’s participation in the BRI. He questioned China’s intent regarding the first point. Mr. Khanal, finally, suggested that China is looking to increase its the closeness with Nepal so as to discourage Nepal’s closeness with the US.\r\n<h2>Tension in India-China Relations Regarding India-China relationship</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nDr. Devendra Kumar expressed that the key point that holds the two together is their economic bond. He said that China and India improved their relationship in the early 80’s. He further added that the Indian government was in dilemma whether to improve their economic relations or the border issue first. Dr. Kumar also added that after the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan which led to China’s shift in focus towards Pakistan. To prevent regional tensions, the Indian government then improved economic relations with China. Regarding the boundary issues, Dr. Kumar assessed that India is waiting for Chinese reaction on whether or not it reduces the tension alongside the border. As it is unsure how China will be taking this economic relationship further, Dr. Kumar said that India is taking initiatives by signing IndiaJapan partnership in Asia-Africa corridor, India’s partnership with Russia in building North South Corridor and Maritime corridor which was announced in 2019, and India has also joined IndoPacific Economic Framework. Dr. Kumar concluded with the statement that in order to learn more about India-China relations, we need to look at how China behaves and what actions India will take after that.<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h1>Panel III – Nepal-China BRI Agreement: Sectoral Perspectives</h1>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/ckfinder/userfiles/images/bri-panel3_1673331992.JPG\" style=\"width: 1429px; height: 817px;\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third Panel of the seminar discussed on ‘Nepal-China BRI agreement: Sectoral Perspectives’ which brought together Mr. Purushottam Ojha, the Former Secretary of Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, Mr. Akhilesh Updhayay, Senior Fellow at IIDS, Dr. Rupak Sapkota, Former Deputy Executive Director at Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA) and Ms. Shreeya Rana, Senior Program &amp; Research Officer, Policy Entrepreneurs Inc. (PEI) which was moderated by Mr. Amish Raj Mulmi, noted author.\r\n<h2>Changing Geopolitical Context and Trends of BRI</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Amish Raj Mulmi began the discussion by highlighting the BRI as an instrument of economic engagement with impacts at the governance and political level. He spoke upon the economic viability brought forth by the BRI projects, recent slow-down on BRI from both Nepal and China, and the viability of BRI 2.0. Mr. Akhilesh Upadhayay shared that BRI is perceived as a potential win by the Global South due to its promises of large-scale infrastructural investment. As we have learned from the Sri Lankan economic crisis, and given that the BRI projects have not begun as of yet, Nepal is in a sweet spot as it can still negotiate a better deal. ‘In a globalized world of today, we can benefit from stronger ties with China. Now is the time to use our leadership to negotiate better deals with China regarding the BRI,’ he added. He provided the example of how the Marshall Plan brought economic ties and prosperity in Europe, which in turn benefited the US.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, BRI can bring economic prosperity in South Asia, which means China needs us as much as we need it. However, dealing with China comes with its own strings attached, as it often expects political support in return, sometimes in controversial issues, like Taiwan and Tibet. Since that goes against Nepal’s fundamentals of democracy, our leadership becomes all the more important to tread diplomatically with China. He also inferred an emerging trend of countries getting debt-trapped by China, with the flashing example of Sri Lanka. However, it becomes important to remember that Sri Lanka already had a dire financial condition coupled with a corrupt government, and that the Chinese loans only played its role in the economy’s deterioration. He pointed out that ‘we often expect for better diplomatic ties to be with no strings attached, however, in diplomatic ties, there is no free lunch.’ As a small state, we need to nurture a rulebased regime, with transparency and capable people in the government, to negotiate the best deal possible with our regional and global neighbors.\r\n<h2>Chinese Perspective in Nepal-China BRI Agreement</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nDr. Rupak Sapkota began by shedding light on the geopolitical landscape of how China has perceived the world and vice versa, especially after the launch of the BRI in 2013. He mentioned that China is seen as a threat to the liberal world order led by the US. Nevertheless, countries have benefitted by perceiving China as an opportunity for their growth and thereby engaging in better ties with it. With BRI, the US fears that China may become a regional and in turn a global hegemon, which explains the one-sided narrative today. He reiterated that China is working on policy adjustment and restructuring of the BRI with changing global dynamics. He mentioned that about 140 countries have already signed BRI MoU as of 2022 which shows that China has expanded BRI over the globe as evidenced by Nepal being featured in the second International Forum of BRI in 2019 even though it was not in the first time in 2017. He added that although the BRI agreement has the same template of MoUs for all countries, the policy documents and financial modality are different for individual countries. In recent times, the financial modality was found to have been restructured as seen in Sri Lanka. Chinese foreign direct investments have increased after 2020, and some countries have seen success stories whilst others are still cautious about money borrowed from China following the situation of Sri Lanka. He shared the recent policy adjustment of China being more generous as some countries got concession on loans, interest rates and received longer repayment time upon negotiation. He referred to Prof. Kondapalli’s argument on China planning to organise the third international forum of BRI next year which in turn is speculated to bring more changes to the BRI. He reflected back on Nepal being triggered following the blockade of 2015 after the promulgation of Constitution of Nepal and Nepal’s plans to increase economic ties with China. In the current geopolitical situation, growing convergence of India and USA is the foremost challenge for the BRI. With the recent trend in BRI, he suggested that we need to work upon the financial modality covering the mechanism and implementation plan of BRI after learning from our regional neighbors to negotiate better with China.\r\n<h2>Trade Dynamics in Nepal-China BRI agreement</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Purushottam Ojha began his viewpoints by stating that Nepal signed the BRI in 2017 with components of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) inclusive. With decreasing exports and increasing imports in Nepal with China, FTA is bound to be detrimental for the Nepali economy. Although moving forward with the Free Trade Agreement would nonetheless enhance benefits on both sides of Nepal and China, we need to consider factors such as supply of goods and Non-Tariff Barriers. He focused on how despite having several trade agreements with China since 1981, challenges persist when it comes to its implementation. He highlighted how, as per the commitment to the World Trade Organization, China is mandated to provide Duty-Free-Quota-Free to 96% of its tariff line to all Least Developed Countries. Meaning Nepal can export with zero tariff on 4700 goods, which Nepal has yet to reap benefits of due to hindrances such as Non-Tariff Barriers, among others. He delved into the fact that we have failed to implement trade agreements because our border points are not being operated post-COVID-19, and four out of six border points lack access to road services. Despite signing transport agreements in the past and the introduction of the Trans Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network, we still lack transport connectivity at the border points itself. On the part of the government, we have yet to push for the implementation of the connectivity agreements despite having diplomatic missions stationed in five places in China and consultation mechanisms openly mentioned in trade agreements. He stressed that we need to enhance the dialogues and consultation mechanisms to discuss the implementation openly. He suggested that the government and business communities to sit together to discuss on how Nepal and China can develop coherence in trade.\r\n<h2>China in Nepal’s Infrastructure Sector and its Political Economic Perspective</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMs. Shreeya Rana began her viewpoints with China changing its aid perspective to concessional loans with Nepal still wanting grants. She stressed that we need to understand the shift in paradigm and modality of aid over time. She reflected on 2016/17, when despite negotiations and trade-offs in aid, Nepal did not have much to lose and aid was not driven by market conditions as it is now. She opined that not only China, but every other country is looking at its economic opportunity. She added that China is often portrayed as a predatory donor with its vested interests, while other donor countries too have tight conditionalities. She implied that while we are expecting more investment from China, we need to be careful on where our market is going, further adding that India wouldn’t buy the energy produced with Chinese investment. While discussing Chinese projects, she gave the example of Pokhara International Airport, whose financial viability was questioned upon its completion. She mentioned that we need to be clear regarding any projects by Chinese containing the elements of connectivity that are packaged as BRI projects. \"We need to stop being bugged by the old narrative of geopolitical dilemma and move forward with more practical considerations\" she concluded.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Updhayay added that we should carefully approach China for investments and not randomly select projects based on our own political preferences. He also mentioned that we need to change our mindsets regarding development, as highways and concrete skyscrapers are not the only yardstick of development.\r\n<h2>Conclusion: Making the Best of the Opportunity</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe seminar brought forth arguments regarding the merits and demerits of the Nepal-China BRI agreement. If BRI is researched well, Nepal can use those learnings to utilize the initiative for its infrastructural development. As a nation sandwiched between two emerging giants, opportunities to established economic ties with the two will prove beneficial. Stakeholders also agreed that some projects under the BRI were proposed without much homework, but also that it is possible to negotiate them with China for a mutually beneficial agreement. However, Nepal should also be careful regarding China’s controversial loan component. Furthermore, Nepal should use its leadership to re-negotiate with China regarding contentious provisions such as the Free Trade Agreement and Policy Exchange. A better deal can still strike, stakeholders opined. Nepal has had a historic tie with China, undertakings like BRI has the potential to deepen the ties whilst bolstering Nepal’s economy', NULL, 3076, NULL, NULL, 'Prashanti Poudyal, Sourav Dahal', '/uploads/banner_image/1673332205_bri-proceeding.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01', '2023-01-02', NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01-10 17:15:05', '2023-01-10 17:52:33'),

Nine infrastructural projects in Nepal are proposed under the BRI agreement – however, these projects have been in limbo. Apart from BRI, the Chinese engagements have been massively increased in the later years with a visible geopolitical ramification in Nepal. While many perceive the increased Chinese interest in infrastructure projects in Nepal as an opportunity to fulfil its goal of development, its critical implications in Nepal’s political economy cannot be undermined.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChinese funded projects implemented by Chinese entities in Nepal, more often than not, have faced issues of time and cost overrun among others. Among the large-scale China funded infrastructure projects in Nepal, Pokhara International Airport serves as a prime example. There exist increasing concerns on political and economic front regarding it. Further development in BRI is contingent upon China’s foreign policy under Xi Jinping’s third term presidency as well as the orientation and priorities of the new coalition government in Nepal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis necessitates a thorough discussion on prospects and challenges of BRI implementation in Nepal along with social, (geo)political, economic and environmental implications of Chinese engagements (including Chinese funded and contracted projects). In this regard, the Centre for Social Inclusion and Federalism (CESIF) organised a Provincial Level Stakeholders’ discussion (seminar) in collaboration with the Department of Political Science, Prithvi Narayan Campus on “<strong>Chinese Engagements and BRI in Nepal</strong>” on December 10, 2020 at Hotel Crown, Pokhara.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis seminar brought together politicians, bureaucrats, intellectuals, economists, infrastructural experts, businessmen, representatives of the tourism industry and journalists among others to share the initial findings of CESIF’s research on Prospects and Challenges of the Nepal-China BRI Agreement, as well as to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the BRI projects at the Sub-national level. The seminar began with a Welcome note by Mr. Uma Baral, Professor at the Prithivi Narayan Campus, followed by key remarks from CESIF’s Executive Chair, Amb. Vijay Kant Karna on the themes and the context the BRI agreement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/ckfinder/userfiles/images/IMG_20221210_095342_1673334100.jpg\" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe seminar proceeded with a presentation on CESIF’s research on The Prospects and Challenges of the Nepal-China BRI Agreement and its major findings by Ms. Prashanti Poudyal, Researcher at CESIF. Ms. Poudyal succinctly summarized the findings of research with a focus on political, geopolitical implications of the BRI, contentious provisions included in the MoU – particularly Free Trade Agreement and policy exchange, and explained why the BRI in Nepal has been in limbo for the past five years. She reflected on BRI being China’s global strategy in the ‘guise of connectivity’ to expand its sphere of influence starting from its immediate neighborhood to far beyond. And that the US-Led West saw BRI as a threat to its liberal world order. Since both the US and India have remained firmly opposed to the BRI, its implementation could cause further difficulties for Nepal to tread the thin line of geopolitical balance. Notwithstanding, Nepal has not been able to implement the BRI projects and provisions; experts interviewed for CESIF’s research specified varied reasons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirstly, the lack of preparedness on Nepal’s part, which was seen right from the beginning of signing contentious provisions like the Free Trade Agreement and Policy Exchange in the MoU, to the selection of projects. Secondly, BRI has seen a loss in momentum in the global arena especially in the past few years. Third, Nepal has been especially wary regarding China’s perceived debt trap strategy, which further cautioned Nepali politicians to take a firm stance that BRI projects could not be undertaken with the present financial modality. Political leaders also became cautious to deal with Chinese counterparts after experiences in Pokhara International Airport, Budhi Gandaki Hydropower Project and the infamous Hambantota port fiasco.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegarding the Free Trade Agreement, CESIF’s research maintains that FTA would be detrimental to Nepal’s economy due to its already uneven trade ratio with China. Furthermore, as obligated by the WTO, China is already providing 98% of its tariff line for zero-tariff to all LDCs. Nepal however has not been able to utilize that to the fullest, due to various issues like non-tariff barriers among others. Therefore, if Nepal is to move ahead with the FTA with China, there will already be a few spaces with which Nepal can leverage.\r\n<h2>BRI as a Global Strategy</h2>\r\nAmb. Vijay Kant Karna began by stressing upon the strategic aspect of the global initiatives like the BRI and MCC - on how they all have vested interest. After establishing itself as an emerging economy, China then envisioned to become a regional and global power, which gave birth to BRI as a global strategy. President Xi Jinping’s visit in October 2019 highlighted China’s interest in Nepal. Post pandemic and Xi’s rise to the third term, China began restructuring BRI, especially the loan component under it; many speculate that BRI 2.0 will be China’s new endeavor.\r\n\r\n<h2>BRI and Infrastructures</h2>\r\nMr. Amish Raj Mulmi reflected upon how BRI brought enthusiasm in Nepal with its big infrastructural undertakings. However, Nepal had not taken into account the political influence BRI would bring alongside. He said, ‘we need to learn from the experiences of Sri Lanka, which took a commercial loan with high interest rate, which was bound to further cripple its declining economy. Today, 19.6% of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt is Chinese loans, which is a high percentage.’ Now, post pandemic, China is found to be trying to restructure BRI as can be seen in its reduction in frivolous lending since 2019. Mulmi further added that the Nepali economy is in a dire situation with debts accounting 21% of its GDP. Thus, Nepal should tread carefully before accepting further loans, especially if it comes with high interest rate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMulmi also added that BRI should be looked in its profitability as China has invested more than 30 billion dollars in South Asia. Such a large scale investment can prove beneficial for Nepal too. The major question is how will Nepal maintain a fine geopolitical balance with both China and India. Since the Chinese Communist Party has had good relations with the communist parties of Nepal, will the relation between the two nations be determined by the party that leads the parliament next? Further, he asked, will the interaction between the two neighbors be party-to-party or government-to-government?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the attendees, Mr. Bishwas Shankar Palikhe mentioned that there has been no proper study conducted for the BRI and its long-term impacts to Nepal. He further added that the construction of the Pokhara International Airport took longer than planned which further escalated its cost. Mr. Ananda Raj Mulmi, former President of the FNCCI, clarified that the Pokhara International Airport is not part of BRI, however the fact that Pokhara, Nijgadh and Lumbini International Airports are all being constructed within the radius of 1000 Km makes little sense. However, Pokhara International Airport helps to understand the nature of Chinese investment in Nepal. He mentioned that the state should learn from the experiences of the Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka, Railway in Kenya and road projects in Laos, to understand if we can pull of a project with China, who are known for managing and undertaking the entire planning to implementing phase, by involving local collaborators only a little. Roads like Kodari-to-Kathmandu was built from the money China earned from its exports to Nepal; likewise, Mahendra Bridge was constructed by a Chinese company using Nepal’s public funds; ‘thus, we need to be careful on how our resources are used,’ he added.\r\n<h2>Ties between China and Pokhara</h2>\r\nMr. Ananda Raj Mulmi further stressed that Pokhara has played an integral part in NepalChina relations. Pokhara held a special relation with Tibet and thereby have had a long affiliation with the present-day China. Both India and China have funded for projects in Pokhara as it has been significant. In fact, Pokhara-to-Baglung highway as well as Pokharato-Kathmandu highway were constructed strategically. Mr. Lekhnath Bhattarai, a professor at the Prithivi Narayan Campus, mentioned that since BRI has more of a loan component instead of grants, it can help create ownership over the projects. Furthermore, to make BRI effective, industries and the business sector should be involved one way or the other, he opined.\r\n\r\n<h2>Change in Global Geopolitics and the Role of Political parties</h2>\r\nToday there exists an increasing geopolitical competition between the USA and China.&nbsp;Mr. Lekhnath Pandey shared that by 2050, China will be ahead of all in terms of economy. Which makes it all the more important for Nepal to have a balanced relation with both of its neighbours. Mr. Than Bahadur Chhetri mentioned that our political parties now do not have a common national ideology; he opined that our foreign affairs dealings have been on an ad hoc basis which does not quite send out a good message. He echoed that now political parties should have a common ideology with one foot on politics and another on economics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMs. Bidhya Bhattarai, Member of the House of Representative from Kaski - 2, began by sharing that there hasn’t particularly been much discussion in the parliament regarding BRI neither in the media. Furthermore, responsible parties, particularly signatories, were neither questioned afterwards. She further added that we don’t have political discussions on grants and loans like we do on political benefits and alliances. Referring to our political scenario as in a building phase, she opined that it will take time for Nepali politics to mature and we mustn’t lose hope. For now, we must brace ourselves for a multi-polar world with our foreign policies treading carefully. Appreciating CESIF’s research presented, she added that agreements with foreign countries, such as BRI, should be well studied in order for us all to learn from.\r\n<h2>Conclusion: Making the Best of the Opportunity</h2>\r\nStakeholders then discussed about making the best of the opportunity provided with the BRI. Certainly, BRI must be discussed and researched well, however, it can also be a great opportunity for a country like Nepal that wants to expand its infrastructural endeavours. As a nation sandwiched between two emerging giants, opportunities to established economic ties with the two will prove beneficial. Stakeholders also agreed that some projects under the BRI were proposed without much homework, but also that it is possible to still be aware of them and negotiate with China for a mutually beneficial agreement.

In the country context, Nepal maintains military relations with many countries around the globe.', NULL, '<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Military Diplomacy of Nepal</strong></h1>\r\n<br />\r\nThe term military diplomacy emerged post-cold war period. The persuasion of military diplomacy emerged to represent the state\'s national interest. Military diplomacy\'s activities entail gathering security and armed related information of the countries, forming strategic cooperation that suits both, thus, military diplomacy is an essential tool of the state to facilitate its foreign policy aims and objectives. In the country context, Nepal maintains military relations with many countries around the globe. Nepal’s military relations and cooperation have enormously augmented for the past decades.&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>Military Engagements in the history</strong></h2>\r\nThe history of military diplomacy is observed since the time of Nepal’s unification by King Prithvi Narayan Shah. His strategy was defending the nation’s territory from annexation. During Rana period, their strategy was to become Britishers ally to save the country from being colonized. Jung Bahadur Rana assisted Britishers&nbsp;during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Indian-Mutiny\">Indian Mutiny</a>&nbsp;of 1857–58. He sent a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contingent\">contingent</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gurkha-people\">Gurkha</a>&nbsp;soldiers to the British, establishing a tradition of Gurkha&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/armed-force\">military service</a>&nbsp;in the British army. Furthermore, he was able to bring back four districts of Nepal through negotiation with the Britishers.\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFurther, King Mahendra initiated Nepal to become a member of United Nations. Relation with China and USSR was established and Nepal adopted non-aligned foreign policy.&nbsp;During the period of Maoist insurgency<strong>, </strong>military aid mostly came from India, US, and the UK. However, Chinese assistance during the insurgency period began and gradually increased. During 2001 – 2004, US granted 29 million as military aid, seeing Maoist as a threat to its part of global “war on terror”. The UN and European nations condemned supporting sides viewing this as a form of human rights violation.&nbsp;In the transition period after signing Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA), Nepal’s internal priority was focused on disarmament and being obliged towards the provisions of CPA. In this period, the Nepal Army lobbied with the government to discontinue the operations of UNMIN (United Nations Mission in Nepal) which was entrusted to support the peace process in Nepal. As Nepal army was dissatisfied with the monitoring of the arms of army and Maoist. In 2011, Madhav Kumar Nepal sent a letter to the UN forcing the UNMIN to exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\n<strong>Nepal’s Military Relations</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u>Nepal Army’s relation with India:</u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal and India established its military cooperation in 1947 after India gained independence from Britishers. The tripartite agreement states that six regiment would transfer to the Indian Army. Until now, 32,000 Gurkha soldiers are serving in the Indian Army. In order to ease the process of retirement services provided by the Indian Army, the military pension branch was set up in Kathmandu, two pension paying offices and 22 district soldiers boards, this is regulated by the Indian Embassy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAside this, Indian and Nepalese Army have a special bond of exchanging special relation due to cultural and linguistic similarities. Nepal and India exchange honorary ranks exchanged with each other’s chief of army staff, military exchanges, military visits, India’s humanitarian assistance in times of crisis for e.g., during the earthquake and COVID-19 India was the first country to help Nepal.&nbsp;Nepal has been buying weapons from India under the 1950 Peace and Friendship. Until 2004 India supplied weapon to Nepal to combat Maoists. After King Gyanendra’s decision to restrict civil liberties and democratic rights, India put hold on its supply of lethal and non-lethal weapons to Nepal government in 2005. In 2013, Nepal Army initially decided to purchase and import 11.132 million cartridges and bullets, 24,166 weapons of various kinds and 81- and 51-mm mortars from India. In 2022 India broke the Chinese monopoly and 8-year-old Chinese cartel in Nepal, an Indian private company has supplied 2 million of the 5.56x45mm rounds for the Nepalese army’s assault rifles under a government-to-government contract route.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<u><strong>Nepal Army’s relation with China:</strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal and China’s military relations can be traced back to formalization of their relations in 1955. In the case of defense cooperation, Nepal sought weapons from China in 1988. Despite ideological differences China consistently provided non-lethal equipment to the Nepal government during the insurgency period. China has supported APF who looks after the border points. Chinese government has supported to build APF training academy. China also showed interest to build National Defense Academy of Nepal Army. Similarly, Chinese announced 2.53 billion rupees grant to Nepal Army to buy better equipment for peace keeping missions. Chinese have provided digital radio trunking systems to enhance communications. In addition to this, Nepal and China began its joint military exercise Sagarmatha Friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<u><strong>Nepal Army’s relation with US:</strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe US cooperates with Nepal in defense cooperation and <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-nepal/\">humanitarian assistance</a>. As Nepal was going through insurgency, Colin Powell paid a visit to Nepal and discussed the possibilities of sending hardware from the U.S to fight against the terror. Initially, the US presence in Nepal was mainly concerned with humanitarian assistance in health, social and economic development. In the case of Arms and ammunition; the Nepal Army acquired the M16 rifles for the first time in 2003 as part of the US government’s support to contain Maoist revolutionaries. Washington provided around 17,000 sophisticated rifles as per the deal with the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in 2002. In 2019, Nepal acquired M4, M-16, and A4 rifles from the US to equip its squad deployed in war-torn countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the recent time, controversies surfaced on Nepal’s application to the United States’ State Partnership Programme. The Nepal Army sent official letter to apply for SPP to the US embassy in 2015 and again in 2017. There was no official letter that was signed between two governments. The controversary surfaces when General Flynn visited Nepal to learn the status of SPP. The concern was raised regarding SPP quoting it was a part of IPS.&nbsp;In response, the document was leaked in the media where Nepal Army had sent an official request to the embassy during the tenure of former COAS Rajendra Chettri. Another proposed 10 points draft agreement was leaked in the media which US claimed it to be fake. Finally, Nepal Government decided not to be a part of SPP. The controversary raises concerns on the credibility of Nepal Army and lack of coordination among the state institutions.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The Role of Nepal Army in Military Diplomacy</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><u><strong>Defense Attach</strong>é :</u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe defense attaché serves in the embassy as a representation of its country.&nbsp; [24] Initially the culture of sending military officers began with French in 1806 which was followed by other European countries. In Nepal\'s context presently there are six defense attaches representing the US, UK, India, China, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The military attache’s role also includes being able to gain insights of the country they are sent in a diplomatic mission. It includes, understanding the culture, perspective of the public and forming a strategic picture of how the attache can benefit from the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<u><strong>UN Peacekeeping Mission:</strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal’s first UN mission was in Lebanon in 1958, Nepal was the only country from South Asia that was selected for the mission. Nepal has been to 44 missions as an observer and peacekeeping troops until 2019<strong>. </strong>The mission does not only benefit economically or diplomatically but the officials gain professional experience after the mission. Nepal Army’s Welfare Fund increases through the levy deducted from the Nepali peacekeepers and reimbursement from the United Nations. It has now reached tentatively around 50 billion NPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<u><strong>Joint Military Training:</strong></u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal Army conducts joint military training as a part showcasing its soft power. Joint Military training is mostly related to familiarize both armies with each other’s weapons, equipment, tactics, techniques and procedures of operating in a counter-insurgency environment in mountainous terrain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Nepal, high altitude and mountain warfare course started from 1990-2018, the countries that have participated are Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, England, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Sweden, US, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, Lebanon, Maldives. The total number of trainees: have reached 287. The most frequent joint military exercises are with India (Surya Kiran), trainings on jungle warfare and high-altitude warfare.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNepal Army have played important role in promoting country’s interest and maintained balanced relationship among countries that it has bilateral ties. In the later period, Nepal’s military, Nepal police and paramilitary force have been primarily supported by China, India and the U.S. The U.S wants to expand its influence with its Indo-Pacific strategy by engaging states through its instruments like MCC, SPP of the US and while China is expanding its presence through BRI. India is also trying to accommodate Nepal into BIMSTEC. Nepal should be cautious to promote its security interest and protect from being dragged into any military alliances. The lack of coordination is seen among the institution especially the line ministries and Nepal Army which automatically affects the preparedness of the country for the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNepal most expand military cooperation with countries with similar interests and in the areas where it can benefit the most. The reputation that Nepal has earned through its long-standing contribution in peace keeping force opens up avenue to promote Nepal’s soft diplomacy. Similarly, the role of Defense Attache plays important role to strengthen Nepal’s military diplomacy. The roles of DAs must be strengthened to facilitate the same.<br />\r\nThe Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs should equally play role to foster benefits through military and defense diplomacy. Lack of coordination and communications among institutions have led to controversies as evident in SPP debate in Nepal. To avoid such situation, line ministries and Nepal Army must come together and form a consensus while dealing related matters.</p>', NULL, 3088, NULL, NULL, 'Prakriti Shree Adhikary', '/uploads/banner_image/1673418072_policy brief - Mil.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01', NULL, NULL, '1', '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2023-01-11 17:06:12', '2023-01-21 12:29:10'),
